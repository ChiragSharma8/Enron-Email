      "Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\n",

      "liability of construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\n",
      "The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\n",
      "any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\n",
      "the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\n",
      "all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\n",
      "loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\n",
      "that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\n",
      "is reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\n",
      "full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\n",
      "the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\n",
      "non-recourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\n",
      "The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\n",
      "architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\n",
      "organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\n",
      "many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\n",
