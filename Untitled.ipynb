Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.

We are able to significantly\\nmove negotiations forward by agreeing to your proposed $100MM\\nCross-Default Thresholds for Cargill-Alliant and Enron North America\\nCorp.  I can also agree to your language and a trigger of BELOW BBB-\\nfor the Additional Event of Default.\\n\\nRegarding the Set-Off issue, I attach language for your consideration\\nwhich demonstrates our agreement to include a Non-Defaulting Party's\\nAffiliates.  This language does not, however, make Set-Off available\\nin all instances, but rather restricts it to the market standard of\\nset-off in cases of any Event of Default and the Credit Event Upon\\nMerger Termination Event.  In light of our agreement to the 3 major\\nitems above, we ask that you consider using the attached language in\\nthis ISDA Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and\\nCargill-Alliant LLC.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I still have no further information on the Guarantee\\nfrom Cargill, Incorporated.

A revised set of rules will be agreed by the end of this year, to\\ntake effect in 2004. There remains broad agreement that it is about time to\\nupdate the original 1988 formula for calculating how much capital a bank\\nneeds. Yet there is enough disagreement on the philosophy and details of the\\nnew proposals to suggest that their implementation will be difficult and\\nexpensive. Perhaps this will prove to be the spur the banking industry\\nneeded to start spending on information technology once again.\\n\\nThe old rules are straightforward enough. Minimum capital requirements are\\nset as a percentage of each bank\\'s assets, with some broad categories of\\nloan, such as mortgages or government debt, assigned reduced weightings. The\\nnew rules are a considerable improvement in this area, tying capital\\nrequirements much more closely to the actual risk posed by individual loans.\\nOddly, though, exceptional treatment is preserved for German real estate\\nloans. But if the measurement of credit risk becomes more sophisticated, the\\naddition of other, worse defined categories of risk - notably operational\\nrisk - restores much of the crudeness of the original agreement.\\n\\nIt would be worth taking more time to reach agreement on the right way of\\nmeasuring operational risk. But political realities, notably the length of\\ntime needed to get an updated European capital adequacy directive to\\nincorporate the new rules, mean that this is unlikely to happen. The result\\nis that Basle II will prove to have a much shorter shelf life than Basle I.\\n\\n\\nAustralia\\'s APRA says Basel home loan rules unfair\\nReuters - June 3, 2001\\nBy Marion Rae\\n\\nSYDNEY, June 4 (Reuters) - Australia\\'s bank regulator said on Monday it\\nbelieved proposed reforms to global capital adequacy requirements by the\\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision could introduce competitive\\ninequalities in the Australian market. In particular, proposals for capital\\nbacking for the residential mortgage market, a dominant and low risk area of\\nbusiness for Australian institutions, needed to be modified, the Australian\\nPrudential Regulation Authority\\'s (APRA) general manager of risk analysis\\nWayne Byers told Reuters.\\n\\nThe Basel committee has proposed that exposures secured by residential\\nproperty attract a 50 percent risk weighting - the same as the current\\nweight - but large institutions able to follow new internal ratings-based\\nguidelines would be able to reflect the very low housing loss experience in\\nAustralia with a cheaper risk weighting of five to 10 percent.\\n\\nWithin the proposed accord there are three methods by which banks can\\ncalculate capital charges for credit risk - a standard method which is a\\nvariant on the current method, and a further two methods, one simple and one\\nadvanced, where banks use their own internal ratings systems as a means of\\nallocating capital.\\n\\n\"Overall the more advanced the method you use, there are some quite\\nsignificant capital savings,\" Byers said.\\n\\n\"The more sophisticated methods aren\\'t restricted to big banks but obviously\\nthey have the knowledge, the resources and the data and that means that\\nthey\\'re more likely to pursue them.\"  As a percentage of total assets as at\\nMarch 2001, APRA said housing loans amounted to an average of 38 percent for\\nAustralia\\'s major banks, including National Australia Bank Ltd, Commonwealth\\nBank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp and the ANZ Banking Group Ltd, and\\n43 percent for regional banks.\\n\\nBIG BANKS STAND TO GAIN\\n\\n\"Given that the minimum requirement is an eight percent capital ratio, banks\\nhave to have A$4 - which is 50 percent - for every A$100 of housing loans\\nthey make,\" he said.\\n\"It would stay the same for those banks that stay on the simplest method but\\nfor those banks which move on to methods where they use their own internal\\nmeasures of risk, a much lower number is produced,\" he said.  \"They\\'re based\\non an international average but Australian data shows it up to be a much\\nlower risk activity,\" he said.\\n\\nAPRA has proposed lowering the standardised housing risk weighting to 20\\npercent or allowing individual countries to allow a weighting lower than\\nBasel requirements where historical loss rates and market characteristics\\nmade this appropriate.  \"I don\\'t think the committee envisaged the big gaps\\nthat have turned out so I would expect they would certainly look to reduce\\nthose gaps between the different methods. I\\'m less sure that they will deal\\nwith product-level issues,\" Byers said.\\n\\n\"Housing loans in Australia are a very low risk activity, they\\'re not\\nnecessarily that in other markets where housing prices are volatile and\\nwhere banks don\\'t necessarily use conservative LVR (loan-to-value) rates,\"\\nhe said.  Capital adequacy rules in Australia required LVRs of less than 80\\npercent, unless backed by mortgage insurance.  \"It may be that we have to do\\nsomething ourselves to tackle that issue. The final proposals will be out at\\nthe end of the year and we\\'re waiting to see how they look before we commit\\nourselves to any action,\" Byers said.\\n\\n\\nAsia May Not Be Ready For New Basel Pact - Ctrl Bankers\\nDow Jones International News - June 3, 2001\\n\\nSINGAPORE (AP)--Asian central bankers Saturday said their countries may not\\nbe ready for the Bank of International Settlements\\' new Capital Accord\\nplanned for 2004.\\n\"In particular, infrastructure and internal capacities in some member\\ncountries could limit their ability to fully implement the accord by then\\n(2004),\" the Governors of the Southeast Asian Central Banks said in a\\ncommunique after a two-day meeting in Singapore.\\n\\nAsia\\'s 1997-98 financial meltdown rocked banks and economies worldwide,\\ndrawing intense international pressure for reform among Asian financial\\ninstitutions.

But it isn\\'t encouraging.  Over the last five months,\\nbankers from around the world have been submitting views on the accord,\\ndubbed Basel 2, which is designed to set the benchmark for bank operations\\nand risk management. By replacing the original 1988 Basel Accords, the new\\nagreement aims to promote better allocation of the money banks must put\\naside for bad loans through the use of more scrupulous risk analysis.\\n\\nOn Friday, reaction to the new pact was made public on the Web site of the\\nBank for International Settlements. The Basel, Switzerland, organization,\\nwhich promotes cooperation among central banks, authored the accord. Big\\nbanks called the plan too conservative, while smaller institutions said it\\nwill increase their cost of capital and warned it could deepen the divide\\nbetween rich and poor nations. Most felt the regulations were onerously\\ncomplex and that the planned 2004 launch date was too ambitious.\\n\\nThe Institute of International Finance, a private association of the world\\'s\\nbiggest banks based in Washington, weighed in Friday with perhaps the most\\ninfluential assessment. \"The proposal includes at every step of the\\ncredit-assessment process an element of conservatism,\" said Jan Kalff,\\nchairman of the IIF steering committee on Basel 2 and former chairman of ABN\\nAmro Bank, who was on a visit to Hong Kong.\\n\\nWhile the risk-analysis procedures mandated by Basel 2 might lower the\\namount of money some banks need to set aside for bad loans, those savings\\nwould be offset by added costs, the IIF said. The hiring and training of new\\nstaff, new software and a general slowing down of the lending process would\\ngenerate those costs.\\n\\n\"Some bankers have mentioned to me that the costs are going to be of the\\nsame magnitude as Y2K implementations. But Y2K was only one-off, this will\\nbe a year after year costly thing,\" said Mr. Kalff. The IIF report estimated\\na total cost to 30,000 banks of $2.25 trillion over five years. Mr. Kalff\\nadded that such costs wouldn\\'t be incurred by nonbanking financial\\ninstitutions, giving them a competitive advantage against traditional banks.\\n\\nAsian central bankers Saturday said their countries may not be ready for the\\nBIS accord. \"In particular, infrastructure and internal capacities in some\\nmember countries could limit their ability to fully implement the accord by\\nthen (2004),\" the Governors of the Southeast Asian Central Banks said after\\na two-day meeting in Singapore.\\n\\nMeanwhile, smaller banks, especially those in the developing world, had\\nother concerns over the Basel 2 draft. \"The proposed approach will result in\\nfostering or even deepening the division into highly developed and\\nunderdeveloped countries, both with respect to external funding and capital\\ncosts,\" wrote Leszek Balcerowicz of the Polish Commission for Bank\\nsupervision.\\n\\nThe problem for emerging-market banks is that their client base typically\\nhas lower credit ratings than those of major banks do. As such, under the\\nnew rules, these banks will have set aside a greater portion of their\\ncapital to cover possible losses. If they don\\'t, they will be punished by\\nhigher costs when they borrow money in international capital markets.\\n\\nAnd borrowers, especially smaller and less credit-worthy ones, will likely\\npay the price with higher capital costs. Again, less-developed nations are\\nlikely to suffer most, since higher capital costs could slow development of\\nhigher-risk small and midsize enterprises.\\n\\nOne complaint shared by big and small banks was Basel 2\\'s insistence that\\nbanks be more widely reviewed by credit-rating agencies to determine asset\\nrisk. In addition to expressing concerns over the added costs of this\\npolicy, some felt it would be counterproductive.\\n\\n\"The increasing reliance on external rating agencies would undermine the\\ninitiatives of banks in enhancing their risk-management policies and\\npractices and internal control,\" said the Reserve Bank of India.  There was\\nalso a general call for more physical collateral, such as property and\\naccounts receivable, to be factored into banks\\' credit risks. \"There is\\nample evidence to show that such collateral is effective in mitigating\\nrisk,\" said Mr. Kalff of the IIF.\\n\\nIn light of such wide-ranging concerns, many felt that it would be difficult\\nto meet Basel 2\\'s scheduled 2004 launch date. The IIF felt that parts of the\\naccord would require at least 18 to 24 months of further negotiations, even\\nthough the BIS has been hoping to finalize the accord by the end of this\\nyear. Developing nations suggested that the accord be phased in over a\\nlonger period of time.  In the words of Adrian Byrne of the Central Bank of\\nIreland: \"This time frame is still too short given the range of information\\nnot available.\"\\n\\n\\nDerivatives industry\\nIFR - June 2, 2001\\n\\nDerivatives industry officials are optimistic that some of their criticisms\\nof the draft of the new Basle II Capital Accord will be taken on board by\\nregulators. They believe there is a good chance that their input on the\\ncalibration of the internal ratings-based function will result in a change\\nin the accord, for example.\\n\\nHowever, there is no sign yet that their input on the \"W\" factor charge on\\ncredit derivatives will result in a revision.  The Basle Committee on\\nBanking Supervision will next month release exposure drafts on operational\\nrisk and the internal ratings based approach for treatment of equities,\\nretail portfolios, project finance and securitisation as areas for\\nadditional consultation and interim papers for its new global capital\\nadequacy rule proposals, dubbed Basle II.  \"These were all green areas when\\nthe consultation came out in January,\" said a Bank for international\\nSettlements official.\\n\\nIt still remains unclear whether the \"W\" factor will be eliminated, he\\nnoted. \"There are some strong proponents for it on the committee. So, it\\ndepends on the nature of the comment letters,\" he said.  William McDonough,\\nthe chairman of the Basle Committee, is widely viewed as having backed away\\nfrom the keeping the \"W\" charge in the new accord, but Oliver Page - the\\nhead of regulatory policy at the UK Financial Services Authority and a\\nmember of the committee - is believed to remain a proponent. Page said that\\nhe is keeping an open mind about the issue, however. \"This is a genuine\\nconsultation process, we have got to weigh up the contributions,\" he said\\nlast Friday, the day after the deadline for comments on the new accord\\npassed.\\n\\nThe \"W\" charge is a 15~~ levy on credit derivatives when they are used for\\ncredit risk mitigation by banks, which contrasts with the zero weighting\\ngiven to guarantees.  The BIS\\'s strategy of weeding out measures that\\nrequire more attention is aimed at enabling the regulator to push ahead with\\ncertain issues and finish formulating its positions on others, while keeping\\nto its 2004 deadline for implementing the new rules, the BIS official said.\\n\"The last thing that they want to do is push ahead with everything and then\\nreopen structural issues,\" said Simon Gleeson, a partner at Allen & Overy in\\nLondon. On the flip side, keeping everything on hold would make it\\nimpossible for it to work within its deadline, he added.\\n\\n\"As far as the European Union is concerned, the problem that they face is\\nthe timing. It took seven years to get [the last Basle Accord] through and\\ninto directive form. The idea that the EU\\'s implementation will get finished\\nby 2004 is absurd,\" a derivatives industry consultant in London said.  The\\nchallenge is exacerbated by the fact that when the EU writes directives they\\napply to all financial institutions, not just internationally active banks.\\nThis means that in addition to implementing the new rules it will have to\\ndraw lines between institutions and decide how to ensure that the system\\ndoes not put small and medium-sized institutions at a disadvantage.\\n\\n\"The Fed wants to start [enforcing new rules] as soon as possible. If they\\ndo, we will get a situation in which we have two completely different\\ncapital adequacy systems,\" the consultant added. The start of 2004 was set\\nas a compromise due date between the US Federal Reserve and the UK\\'s\\nFinancial Services Authority for enforcing the new rules. Basle II\\'s initial\\nindustry comment period closed last Thursday.\\n\\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association focused its criticisms\\non three areas. It argued that the introduction of rigid capital floors\\nwould increase costs, that the proposed operational risk and \"W\" factor\\ncharges are arbitrary, and that the proposed calibration of the internal\\nratings based function does not reflect market practice.\\n\\n\"The accord takes significant steps toward defining an approach to setting\\nbanks\\' capital requirements, which is risk-sensitive, granular and flexible,\\nyet there are several areas that are inconsistent with the overall goals of\\nthe accord and existing bank best practices,\" said Emmanuelle Sebton, head\\nof risk management for ISDA.\\n\\nISDA officials are due to meet the FSA\\'s Page and other members of the\\ncapital group within the Basle Committee in New York in mid July, at which\\nstage ISDA will press the case for abandonment of the 15% \"W\" factor charge\\non use of credit derivatives.\\n\\n\\nConvertible default swap proposal near\\nIFR - June 2, 2001\\n\\nAn informal working group within the International Swaps and Derivatives\\nAssociation\\'s credit derivatives market practice group is nearing the\\ncompletion of a preliminary proposal aimed at creating standardised\\ndocumentation for swaps based on convertible bonds and zero coupon\\nconvertible issues.\\n\\nThe surge in convertible and zero coupon convertible issuance this year and\\nthe trend towards stripping the equity and credit components out of large\\nissues are heightening the need for the documentation.  \"Right now, there\\nisn\\'t a standard. That\\'s the problem. Each firm uses different language.\\nResolving this will enhance liquidity in an already well-functioning\\nmarket,\" said Derek Smith, head of credit derivatives trading at Goldman\\nSachs in New York.\\n\\nCredit derivatives market participants would benefit from standardisation,\\nas it would improve liquidity. \"If you strip a convertible with one dealer\\nand want to unwind with another dealer you might come across dealers that\\ndon\\'t like the documentation. So, they are unlikely to bid, and you are\\nforced to go back to the first dealer,\" said John Tierney, head of credit\\nderivatives research at Deutsche Bank in New York.\\n\\nEven though only a portion of investment grade convertibles are stripped and\\nstripping typically covers between a third and a quarter of a stripped\\nconvertible, the activity still generates vast amounts of credit default\\nswaps business.  On a US$3bn issue, for instance, in excess of US$750m can\\nbe stripped, which is time consuming to offset, given that credit default\\nswaps usually trade in US$10m blocks. Standard documentation is also needed\\nbecause stripping often causes a 30-50% jump in the price of the issuer\\'s\\nsingle name credit default swap.\\n\\n\"It\\'s more technical than controversial. Creating documentation that works\\nis the challenge,\" said Smith. Before the group\\'s proposal is available for\\ngeneral use, it will need to be approved by ISDA\\'s documentation committee\\nand vetted by the industry.\\n\\n\\nCredit Derivatives Market To Hash Out Successor Issues\\nDow Jones - June 4, 2001\\nBy Joe Niedzielski\\n\\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Credit derivatives professionals are working on a\\nsolution to the vexing question of how these contracts should be treated\\nwhen companies spin off units or restructure into separate entities.  These\\ndemerger or successor issues are expected to take some months to resolve and\\nthe International Swaps and Derivatives Associations new subcommittee of the\\ncredit derivatives market practice group has given the question priority\\namong a host of other long-term issues.\\n\\nAdding some momentum to the discussions is the pending restructuring of AT&T\\nCorp. (T). AT&T is among the more actively-traded credits in the single name\\ncredit default swap market.  These over-the-counter derivatives contracts\\nlet buyers transfer the default risk on loans or bonds by selling it to a\\nthird party for a premium that\\'s derived from the notional amount of the\\ncontract.\\n\\nAT&T\\'s plan, first unveiled last fall, would split the company into a\\nbusiness and consumer long-distance unit, as well as broadband and wireless\\nunits. AT&T is expected to go ahead with the plan in the coming months.\\n\"People seem motivated about resolving this,\" said one credit derivatives\\nofficial in New York. \"As AT&T gets closer, I would imagine that would\\ngalvanize people further on this side of the Atlantic.\"\\n\\nWhen companies split up, spin off units, or \"demerge,\" the successor\\nentities are allocated different portions of the previous entities\\noutstanding debt obligations and publicly-issued bonds.  ISDA\\'s 1999\\ndocument governing credit derivatives essentially calls for the default swap\\nto follow the entity that takes on the majority of the obligations in a\\nmerger, consolidation, or transfer.  This \"all or substantially all\" clause\\nin the documentation, though, can be interpreted differently in other legal\\njurisdictions. And that could pose a problem if a market participant has\\ncontracts on a particular credit with U.S. and English counterparties.\\n\\nStill Fallout From National Power\\n\\nA number of market participants are attempting to negotiate a resolution to\\ndefault swaps written on the U.K.\\'s National Power PLC, which demerged late\\nlast year.  In the split, Innogy Holdings PLC (IOG) received the former\\ncompany\\'s U.K.-based power and generating assets. National Power changed its\\nname to International Power PLC (IPR) and took the international power\\nassets.\\n\\nInnogy Holdings was also allocated with about 60% of the former company\\'s\\ndebt obligations and about 88% of its public bonds. International Power kept\\nabout 40% of the former company\\'s debt obligations and about 12% of its\\npublic bonds.  The credit derivatives official in New York said there are\\ntheoretical ways of hashing out the successor issue. One possible approach\\nwould be to have multi-name default swaps after a demerger for participants\\nthat held contracts on the single name corporate prior to the demerger.\\n\\nEssentially, the trade would be split into a series of trades on the\\ndemerged entities, though it would likely be difficult to calculate the\\nrelevant notional amounts that should be allocated among those new default\\nswaps, this person said.\\n\\n\\nTwo banks pull out of Argentina debt swap over SEC rule fears\\nFinancial Times - Jun 2, 2001\\nBy Thomas Catan\\n\\nTwo investment banks unexpectedly pulled out of managing Argentina\\'s record\\ndebt exchange yesterday because of worries they may have violated US\\nsecurities regulations, placing at risk millions of dollars in fees.\\nOn the advice of their lawyers, Deutsche Bank and ABN-Amro yesterday\\nwithdrew from a group of 12 banks chosen by the Argentine government to\\nmanage the multi-billion dollar transaction. It is understood that Banco de\\nGalicia, an Argentine bank, will also exclude itself from offering the bonds\\nin the US.\\n\\nPeople close to the banks said company lawyers had become concerned that\\nsome pieces of research in the run-up to the transaction may have breached\\nUS securities regulations. A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission in Washington would neither confirm nor deny it had warned\\ninvestment banks.\\n\\nIn an effort to buy time to restart its struggling economy, Argentina hopes\\nto exchange bonds coming due before 2006 for longer-dated paper. The\\ngovernment stopped taking offers from bondholders yesterday and is due to\\nannounce the results of the massive operation on Monday. Market analysts\\nexpect the government will succeed in swapping around Dollars 20bn, by far\\nthe largest transaction of its type.\\n\\nIf that is the case, the group of investment banks would earn Dollars 110m,\\nwhich is considered to be a juicy fee for relatively light work. However,\\nconcerns that the \"Chinese wall\" between analysts and sales people had been\\nbreached may have cost several banks their share of the fees.\\n\\nSome bankers suggested it was not the SEC that had raised the initial\\nobjection, but rather investment banks threatening each other to maximise\\ntheir proportion of the fees. According to an Argentine official, the\\nproblem first came to light on Thursday after questions were raised about a\\nresearch report by Deutsche Bank\\'s emerging markets analysts.\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Clash Over Power-Grid Control\\nThe Wall Street Journal - May 4, 2001\\nBy Rebecca Smith\\n\\nAs California politicians wade deeper into the energy crisis, the state\\'s\\nelectric-grid operator appears headed toward a showdown with federal energy\\nregulators over whether its board is independent enough.  The California\\nIndependent System Operator Friday bowed to pressure from the Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission and submitted its qualifications to continue as a\\nfederally sanctioned grid operator. But the tardy filing is almost certain\\nto be challenged by federal regulators and market participants because the\\nISO\\'s governance structure has strayed from a \"bedrock requirement\" that it\\nbe \"independent of control by any market participant.\"\\n\\nThe market participant casting the long shadow is the state of California.\\nSince January, when the state of California began buying huge sums of\\nelectricity on behalf of its nearly broke utilities, the ISO has been under\\npressure to give state officials preferential treatment and unique access to\\nmarket-sensitive information. Its chief operations officer, paid $245,000 a\\nyear according to the most recent IRS filing, is on indefinite loan to the\\ngovernor\\'s office where he is working as an energy adviser.\\n\\nThis politicization of the ISO is significant because the organization\\'s\\npurpose is to run a market for power needed to keep the electric system in\\nbalance and to give buyers and sellers impartial access to the power lines\\non which they depend to move electricity. Unlike other commodities,\\nelectricity can\\'t be stored. Transactions, therefore, depend completely on\\ninstantaneous access to the electric superhighway of high-voltage lines. The\\nFERC worries that a loss of political independence by the ISO will further\\ndegrade the state\\'s already dysfunctional energy market.\\n\\nThe FERC hasn\\'t formally accused the ISO of acting improperly, but it is\\nclear that a wall between the state and the ISO that once was solid has\\nbecome permeable. Last month, the ISO notified the FERC that the state of\\nCalifornia had asserted \"it must have access to the ISO control room floor\"\\nand \"nonpublic information\" as a \"necessary condition\" of continuing to buy\\npower, even though such preferential access violates ISO rules. But without\\nthe state to back power purchases -- it has spent nearly $8 billion on\\nelectricity since January -- the ISO\\'s market would collapse and blackouts\\nand chaos likely would ensue.\\n\\nThe governance issue, which may appear esoteric, actually cuts to the heart\\nof the power crisis in California. State officials feel they have ceded too\\nmuch control to the FERC, which they accuse of shirking its duty to protect\\nconsumers. As a consequence, the state has forced its way into the inner\\nworkings of the formerly arcane ISO, a public-benefit corporation formed\\nthree years ago amid California\\'s push to deregulate its electricity market.\\n\\nIn January, the state legislature authorized the governor to eject a\\nFERC-approved board of directors and hand pick his own five-member ISO\\nboard. The state attorney general ordered old board members to resign or\\nface personal fines of $5,000. Currently, one ISO board member is a former\\nmember of the governor\\'s staff, while another, on the governor\\'s behalf,\\nnegotiated the proposed purchase of utility transmission assets by the\\nstate, all the while serving as chairman of the supposedly independent\\nboard.\\n\\nThe ISO\\'s chairman says changes in the board structure have made the ISO\\nmore answerable to the citizenry and \"efficient.\" Michael Kahn, who is a San\\nFrancisco attorney, added that the governance structure had to change to\\nreflect the fact that \"we\\'re in a state of emergency.\"\\n\\nIn its filing Friday, the ISO took the position that the tighter\\nrelationship between the ISO\\'s board and the state doesn\\'t violate the\\nFERC\\'s requirement that ISO boards be free of control by market\\nparticipants. Even though the state has been \"required to provide financial\\nsupport,\" the ISO asserts, this \"participation does not make ... the State a\\nmarket participant.\" Many market watchers scoff at that contention.\\n\\n\"Inevitably, this will lead to a showdown,\" said N. Beth Emery, former\\ngeneral counsel of the ISO and now an energy attorney for Ballard, Spahr,\\nAndrews & Ingersoll in Washington, D.C. \"Clearly, the ISO is in violation of\\nthe independence requirement.\"\\n\\nBut the FERC doesn\\'t have many tools for enforcing its vision of autonomy.\\nThat may explain why it has failed to intervene. It can order the ISO to\\nmake board changes, for instance. But if it refuses, there may not be much\\nthe FERC can do except threaten to rescind the ISO\\'s operating tariffs.\\nThat, of course, is the opposite of what the FERC wants to do, which is\\nencourage creation of multistate grid organizations free of any political\\nfavoritism.\\n\\nBut California\\'s angry isolationism appears to be growing. Gov. Gray Davis\\nsaid the ISO\\'s filing ensured the state will \"maintain control of our own\\nenergy destiny and not be subject to the whims of federal regulators or the\\ninterests of other states.\"\\n\\nTo date, the FERC has been steadfast in its resolve to make regional grid\\noperators independent organizations, free of control of utilities and power\\nmarketers. It has rejected other grid-operator proposals because it felt\\nutilities that owned the power lines were attempting to retain too much\\ncontrol. But Order 2000, the landmark decision issued in December 1999 that\\npromoted the creation of independent grid runners throughout the nation,\\nnever contemplated a state government assuming such a huge role in a market\\nas has occurred in California.\\n\\nIf anything, that role is likely to increase. Not only is the state of\\nCalifornia the biggest power buyer in the nation now, but it has formed a\\npower authority that intends to build and operate generating plants. In\\naddition, Mr. Davis is promoting a plan to buy the transmission systems of\\nthe state\\'s investor-owned utilities. As such, a new vertically integrated\\nutility is forming that could be larger than any the nation has seen since\\nthe \"power trusts\" of the 1930s were broken apart by Congress.\\n\\nIt is rife with conflicts of interest. The ISO\\'s drift has created a fissure\\nin the solid support it enjoyed from the state\\'s big utilities that\\ntransferred control of their transmission systems to the ISO in 1998. PG&E\\nCorp.\\'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit, which is in bankruptcy proceedings,\\ndeclined to join the ISO filing, which was supported by Edison\\nInternational\\'s Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy\\'s San\\nDiego Gas & Electric Co. unit. PG&E said in a separate grid-plan filing that\\nit would prefer the ISO join a multistate grid organization. It expressed\\nreservations about the independence of the current board.\\n\\nOpposition to the state\\'s influence is becoming more vocal. The Electric\\nPower Supply Association, a trade group representing power producers, warned\\nFERC last month that the ISO has become \"a partisan advocate for the State\\nof California\" and sought FERC intervention to defend the rights of all\\nmarket interests.\\n\\n\\nNewer options\\nBusiness Standard - June 4, 2001\\nBy Gaurav Dua\\n\\nIn addition to the numerous advantages of derivatives in terms of risk\\nmanagement, price discovery and instruments for providing the required\\nleverage to the investor, options are also very effectively used as a tool\\nto develop and structure innovative products. Investment bankers use various\\nform of options including call, put, exotic, binary and so on, to structure\\nproducts for retail investors. Such products have gained immense popularity\\nin developed markets like the US and Europe.\\n\\nIn fact, structured products offered by investment banks like Salomon Smith\\nBarney (SSB), Goldman Sachs and others, are also actively traded at the\\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These relatively new investment\\nvehicles are similar to call or put options as they have an expiration date,\\nand are cash settled like index options. The capital markets division at\\nCBOE assesses the concept behind the instrument and provides regulatory\\nguidance before the product is offered in the market.\\n\\nOne of the very successful and popular examples of structured products is\\ncapital protected notes where the return on investment is linked to the\\nperformance of certain indices, basket of stocks or a single stock in a\\ngiven time frame. Here, the investment bank or intermediaries will calculate\\nthe present value of risk-free interest that can be earned\\n\\n* on the capital and use it to buy\\n\\n* call options. The best part of the instrument is that there is no\\nrisk\\n\\n* of capital loss. And the risk of the investor is only limited to the\\n\\n* interest that could have been earned on the capital.\\n\\nThis apart, exotic options like knock-in or knock-out options, where the\\nexpiry of the option is based on certain conditions, are utilised to provide\\nflexibility and additional features to the investors. For instance,\\nstructured products such as Target Trust Warrants offered by SSB guarantees\\nan assured return of six per cent with no risk to the capital and investor\\ncan opt for redemption before the expiry date. But there is a cap on the\\nmaximum amount of return that can be earned on the deposit.\\n\\nA typical example of index based structured product is Equity based notes by\\nSSB where the returns to the investor is based on the\\n\\n* appreciation in Dow Jones\\n\\n* Industrial Average in a given time frame. This product is actively\\ntraded on CBOE.\\n\\nIn the Indian context, structured products could very well fill in the gap\\nbetween the high risk high return equity investments and low risk low return\\nfixed deposits by banks. The drop of 150 basis in the interest rate on\\npopular investment avenues such as public provident fund, national saving\\ncertificate and others, has already compelled the small investors to look at\\nothers investment alternatives for higher returns. In such a scenario,\\nstructured products are expected to do well in India.\\n\\nStructured products could turn out to be a boon for numerous software\\nprofessionals who were unable to cash-in on their employee stock option\\n(ESOP) in the bull-run due to the lock-in period. \"Investments bankers could\\ntarget such professionals with customised structured products using put\\noptions\", says Sanjiv Mehta, chief executive officer derivative segment,\\nBombay Stock Exchange. Normally, customised structured products are used for\\nhigh networth clients.\\n\\n\\n**End of ISDA Press Report for June 4, 2001**\\n\\nTHE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA\\'S\\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA.

       "  'Body': 'Here\\'s an editorial that gets to the heart of the matter.  \\n\\n\\nTuesday, July 10, 2001 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGhost of Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol \\nGray Davis is following footsteps of former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJOHN M.W. MOORLACH \\nMr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector. \\n\\nA recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced \\nthat our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state\\'s \\nsubsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has \\ncaused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not. \\nThe state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city\\'s \\nannual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the \\nsame financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned \\nutilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the \\nprecipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring \\na Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face. \\nThat\\'s why I\\'m gnawed by this \"d,j. vu\" sensation. The similarities and \\nparallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are \\nfrightening. Here\\'s a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer \\nRobert Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. \\nThe \"experts\" and the \"politicos\" were comfortable with the investment \\nscheme. \\nNo wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing \\nimproprieties. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how \\nhe was investing and what his \"exit strategy\" would be. Guess what? The \\nunexpected happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of \\nborrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated. \\nIt caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers realized \\na $1.64 billion loss. In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck \\nthe county\\'s leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a \\nhalf-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that the \\nutilities can charge. It also eliminated the availability to acquire \\nelectricity through the use of long-term contracts. \\nGuess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for electricity \\nspiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It depleted the \\navailable funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are imploding. In \\nspite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis to avoid or \\nminimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also history. \\nIt gets worse. Davis doesn\\'t allow for the immediate raising of retail rates \\nand decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess what? The \\nexpected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves! Nearly $9 \\nbillion - and counting! He\\'s a Citron, only quintupled! \\nAnd in the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced \\nand only compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no \\nLibertarian or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He \\nhas returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of \\nCalifornia by subsidizing their electricity bills. \\nBravo! It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes, but has \\nanyone ever thought up a more efficient method? But, that\\'s not all. He wants \\nit back! Davis now wants to borrow some $13 billion to replace the spent \\nreserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail \\nprices! When does this train wreck in slow motion stop? \\nAnd how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not want to raise rates last \\nsummer or this past winter. But now he will to pay off this historically \\nlargest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase. The \\nratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davis is gone about his \\nexpensive brilliance. And this elected official wants to purchase the power \\ngrids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say \"no.\" \\nIf we don\\'t show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond buyers \\nwill also say \"no,\" unless they receive an attractive interest rate. Just ask \\nEdison International about attractive interest rates. It just subscribed $800 \\nmillion in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis walked into his \\nposition with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to \\nshow for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new schools. No \\ninfrastructure improvements. Only interest payments. \\nWasn\\'t that Citron\\'s legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the \\ncitizens of California will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. \\nOver 15 years it\\'s $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, \\nsquandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting \\nfrom his indecisiveness and lack of leadership! \\nIt is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial \\nand continues to play the \"blame game.\" Orange County played the \"blame \\ngame,\" too. But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law \\nin securing a significant amount in retribution payments. I\\'m not so sure \\nCalifornia will have a similar result.',\n",

More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.\\n\\nWe are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t2001\\t2000\\n\\tFriendliness\\t\\t88%\\t84%\\n\\tCourtesy\\t\\t89%\\t84%\\n\\tKnowledge/Training\\t86%\\t80%\\n\\tRange of Services\\t87%\\t82%\\n\\tSaving Interest Rates\\t66%\\t60%\\n\\tLoan Interest Rates\\t65%\\t58%\\n\\tQuality of Service\\t88%\\t84%\\n\\tCommunications\\t84%\\t79%\\n\\tWeb Portal\\t\\t72%\\tN/A\\n\\tService Wait Time\\t79%\\t68%\\n\\n\\nOf course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:\\n\\nATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:\\n\\n-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.\\n-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).\\t\\n-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).\\n-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.\\n\\n\\nPhone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.\\n\\nShould you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\nWait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.\\n\\nWe added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:\\n\\n-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.\\n-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.\\n-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.\\n-  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com.\\n-  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up.\\n\\nThank you again for your feedback.  We look forward to the opportunity to bring you more of the latest financial services as they become available in the market.\",\n",

They cannot ensure that the \\nemployee doesn't write the password on his or her palm to take it with them.  \\nApparently, they have had some bad experiences with disgruntled traders.  \\nThus, their proposal that their notice must be by certified mail and the \\nproviso that we have 5 days to act on the notice.\\n\\nI have a question regarding the back office suggestion -- are you suggesting \\nthat no individual trader be given an id but rather you give the id to \\nsomeone in the back office and the trader has to call that individual to \\nactually submit a trade.  If that's not what you intend, even if the back \\noffice or control group holds the password, if the trader knows the password \\nto get into EOL, what's to stop him or her from continuing to access EOL \\nafter leaving the company.  The back office can notify EOL that the password \\nshould be cancelled, but if we don't act on the notice, what is left for the \\nCP to do.\\n\\nWho should be my EOL contact on this issue and other ETA issues?\\n\\nLeslie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tMark Taylor\\n\\t07/20/2000 01:55 PM\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t To: Leslie Hansen/HOU/ECT@ECT\\n\\t\\t cc: \\n\\t\\t Subject: Re: Kennecott ETA\\n\\nYou're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other \\ncounterparties.  I doubt that the EOL people will let us do it (though we can \\nalways ask).  I have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this \\nissue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by \\nsomeone in the back office, the control group or even the legal department so \\nthat when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off.  It \\nseems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with \\nrogues where it belongs - why should we be at risk if one of their traders \\ndecides to damage the company?  Having said that, I think that even without \\nthe last sentence requested we are probably in that position - if we have \\nactually received the notice and request for termination of the password and \\ndon't do it, it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they \\ncan show they weren't authorized.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tLeslie Hansen\\n\\t07/20/2000 12:25 PM\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\\n\\t\\t cc: \\n\\t\\t Subject: Kennecott ETA\\n\\nMark:\\n\\nAs I mentioned in my voice mail, Kennecott Coal Sales has requested the \\nfollowing modification to the ETA:\\n\\nSection 6(a) shall be revised to provide that Enron shall use reasonable \\nefforts to cancel CP's master user password and/or user IDs upon receipt of \\nnotice from CP.

Action in California. The governors call upon California to redouble its \\nefforts to conserve electricity and to stabilize prices and its electric \\npower market. \\n\\n2. FERC Investigation. The governors thank Chairman Hoecker for his offer of \\nassistance and ask that his staff prepare an immediate report on the\\nimplications and potential consequences of regional price caps and bilateral \\ncontracts, and to investigate: why Western electricity prices have been so \\nhigh; who\\nhas benefitted from these high prices; and whether generating capacity has \\nbeen held back. This information will be useful whatever the individual \\ngovernors\\nviews on these matters. \\n\\n3. Energy Conservation. The governors commit to and ask their western \\ngubernatorial colleagues to join them in implementing a coordinated, \\nstate-by-state,\\nvoluntary conservation strategy to free up electricity in the West starting \\nno later than January 1. This plan would encourage consumers at every scale \\nto reduce\\nor reschedule electricity demand and would encourage state public service \\ncommissions to review and adopt other steps such as mechanisms to pay users \\nfor\\nforgoing power during times of high demand. Furthermore, the governors agree \\nand ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in reducing the\\nelectricity consumed by public agencies in their states. The states will \\ncoordinate an energy conservation response by December 28. \\n\\n4. Presidential Task Force. The governors call upon their colleague \\nPresident-elect Bush to convene a formal team to work with the western \\ngovernors on\\nthis urgent issue while waiting for appointments to be made. \\n\\n5. Increasing Supply. The governors will convene in late January or early \\nFebruary a meeting of all the affected parties to prepare a vision and action \\nplan for\\nthe west's energy future and its relation to a national energy policy, \\nincluding increasing the supply and availability of electricity and energy \\nthroughout the region\\ntoday and in the future. The governors called for this meeting at the winter \\n2000 meeting of the Western Governors' Association; due to the current energy\\ncrisis they have fast-tracked this meeting and the development of a \\nhemispheric energy policy.\",\n",

We still live\\nin  the greatest country in the world and sometimes we forget what we have\\nworked so hard for.   This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.\\n\\nAmerica: The Good Neighbor.\\nWidespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to A\\nremarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a\\nCanadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his\\ntrenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:\\n\\n\"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the\\nmost generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.\\nGermany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out\\nof the debris of war by the Americans who poured in\\nbillions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these\\ncountries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the\\nUnited States.\\nWhen France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who\\npropped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the\\nstreets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.\\nWhen earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries\\nin to help. This spring, 59 American communities were\\nflattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.\\nThe Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into\\ndiscouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing\\nabout  the decadent, warmongering Americans.\\nI\\'d like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the\\nerosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.\\nDoes any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing\\nJumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10?\\nIf so, why don\\'t they fly them? Why do all the International lines except\\nRussia fly American Planes?\\nWhy does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on\\nthe moon?\\nYou talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.\\nYou talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.\\nYou talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not\\nonce, but several times - and safely home again.\\nYou talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store\\nwindow for everybody to look at.\\nEven their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on\\nour streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are\\ngetting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.\\nWhen the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking\\nDown through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the\\nPennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned\\nthem an old caboose. Both are still broke.\\nI can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other\\npeople in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced\\nto the Americans in trouble? I don\\'t think there was outside help even\\nduring the San Francisco earthquake.\\nOur neighbors have faced it alone, and I\\'m one Canadian who is damned\\ntired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing\\nwith their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their\\nnose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope\\nCanada\\nis not one of those.\"',\n",

Justice\\ndidn\\'t recommend that the FCC reject the application, but it did\\nraise several questions, including whether SBC\\'s unbundled\\nnetwork element rates in Missouri complied with the FCC\\'s TELRIC\\n(total-element long-run incremental cost) standard (TR, May 14).\\n\\n\"We believe our application for Missouri passes all the tests,\\nand Missouri regulators agreed by unanimously endorsing our\\napplication,\" said Priscilla Hill-Ardoin, SBC senior vice\\npresident.  \"Our markets are open, as the rapid growth of\\ncompetition in the state demonstrates.  But it is important that\\nour application record include a comprehensive response to\\nseveral new issues raised since our Missouri application was\\nfiled.  We would rather the FCC vote on the most current\\ninformation available.\"\\n\\nIn a statement issued late this afternoon, FCC Chairman Michael\\nK. Powell said, \"During the FCC Common Carrier Bureau\\'s review of\\nSBC\\'s section 271 application for authority to offer long\\ndistance service in Missouri, concerns surfaced related to cost-\\nbased pricing in its region and operation support systems (OSS).\\nGiven these concerns SBC has chosen to withdraw the application.\"\\nMr. Powell said the proceeding was \"terminated until such time as\\nSBC has addressed these issues and is prepared to resubmit its\\napplication.\"\\n\\n\\n***************************************************************\\nLAWMAKERS, POLICY ADVOCATES PITCH BROADBAND SERVICE BILLS\\n\\nWith key votes on broadband services legislation approaching in\\nthe House -- including a possible floor vote on HR 1542 later\\nthis month -- telecom lawmakers and industry officials today made\\na new round of policy pitches on the subject.  Their audience was\\nthe more than 100 congressional staffers at today\\'s Internet\\nCaucus luncheon in the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nThe luncheon at times seemed like a mini-hearing:  Lawmakers\\noffered their usual arguments, challenged each other\\'s claims,\\nand asked those in attendance for support.  In a separate panel\\nheld later, industry representatives drew swords over broadband\\nservices legislation.\\n\\nCarrying the flag for the Bell companies\\' bill of choice, the\\nInternet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act, HR 1542, were Rep.\\nW.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.), its author, and Reps. Rick Boucher\\n(D., Va.), and Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.).  Filling out the\\ncongressional panel were two of the more outspoken skeptics of\\nthe data-relief legislation -- Reps. Steve Largent (R., Okla.)\\nand Christopher Cannon (R., Utah).\\n\\nRep. Largent argued that HR 1542\\'s provision to eliminate the in-\\nregion interLATA (local access and transport area) restrictions\\non the Bell companies\\' provision of data services would remove\\nthe Bells\\' incentive to open their local markets.  \"It\\'s like\\nchanging the rules of the game in the middle of the game,\" he\\nsaid.  \"No other industry has that kind of domination by one\\nentity. . .like the Bells do in the local loop.\"\\n\\nRep. Tauzin fired back, saying the Bell companies were \"always in\\nthe middle of a game.\"  The 14-point market-opening check-list\\nfound in section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \"has\\nbecome 1,100 points,\" he said.  \"And the FCC has gummed things up\\nso badly, that AT&T [Corp.] can sit there beautifully and stymie\\nentry\" into the cable modem market, he said.\\n\\nHR 1542 would correct that discrepancy and spur competition by\\nputting the Bells\\' provision of advanced services on equal\\nregulatory footing with the broadband offerings of cable TV\\nproviders, said Reps. Boucher and Tauzin.  \"But AT&T loves the\\nstatus quo so much. . .that\\'s why they\\'ve spent all this money on\\nTV ads opposing\" HR 1542, Rep. Tauzin said.  There is a \"good\\nchance\" that HR 1542 will be taken up on the House floor before\\nthe July 4 break, he said.\\n\\nRep. Cannon, who advocates a different approach to spurring\\nadvanced service deployment, said AT&T Chairman and Chief\\nExecutive Officer C. Michael Armstrong told him yesterday that\\nCongress\\'s consideration of HR 1542 has contributed to Wall\\nStreet\\'s sour outlook on the competitive local exchange carrier\\n(CLEC) industry.\\n\\n\"Mr. Armstrong said he had no interest in buying a [CLEC] as long\\nas HR 1542 is out there,\" Rep. Cannon said.  \"I don\\'t agree that\\nthose companies are failing because of bad business plans,\" he\\nadded.  \"The Bells have blocked their access\" to local markets.\\n\\nDuring the industry panel, HR 1542\\'s provision to scale back the\\nFCC\\'s rules on \"line sharing\" sparked debate between Larry\\nClinton, vice president-large company affairs for the U.S.\\nTelecom Association, and Thomas Koutsky, VP-law and public policy\\nfor Z-Tel Technologies, Inc.\\n\\n\"If you want competition for local phone service, you don\\'t want\\nline sharing,\" Mr. Clinton told attendees.  But Mr. Koutsky said\\n\"the point of line sharing and unbundling was to provide rings\\nfor CLECs to climb into the market.\"  Passage of HR 1542 would\\nremove those market-access elements, he said.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************************\\nCARRIERS ASK WIRELESS BUREAU TO RETHINK `E911\\' DECISION\\n\\nFour carriers have asked the FCC\\'s Wireless Telecommunications\\nBureau to reconsider its decision regarding who should pay for\\nPhase I enhanced \"911\" (E911) systems.  In a May 7 letter, bureau\\nChief Thomas J. Sugrue said the 911 selective router maintained\\nby incumbent local exchange carriers was the proper demarcation\\npoint for allocating E911 implementation costs between wireless\\ncarriers and public safety answering points (PSAPs) (TR, May 14).\\nMr. Sugrue was responding to a request for clarification from the\\nKing County, Wash., E911 program (TR, Aug. 21, 2000).\\n\\nThe bureau\\'s decision supported the PSAPs\\' argument regarding the\\ndemarcation point.  Carriers, on the other hand, had maintained\\nthat PSAPs should be responsible for E911 network components or\\nupgrades beginning at the wireless carrier\\'s mobile switching\\ncenter, not the 911 selective router.\\n\\nIn a petition filed yesterday in Common Carrier docket 94-102,\\nQwest Wireless LLC, Verizon Wireless, VoiceStream Wireless Corp.,\\nand Nextel Communications, Inc., said the bureau\\'s decision \"is\\ninconsistent with the Commission\\'s rules and underlying orders\\nand is beyond the bureau\\'s delegated authority.\"  They asked the\\nbureau to designate the mobile switching center as the\\ndemarcation point.\\n\\nThe carriers charged that the bureau failed to follow the Ad-\\nministrative Procedure Act\\'s mandate that it consider and respond\\nto \"significant\" comments filed in the record of the proceeding.\\nThe companies also said the bureau\\'s decision required a formal\\nrulemaking by the full Commission.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************************\\nMCI SHARES BEGIN TRADING AGAIN, AS WorldCom ISSUES TRACKING STOCK\\n\\nWorldCom, Inc., has split each share of its common stock into two\\ntracking stocks, one of which will reflect the performance of the\\nunit that provides long distance service to consumers and small\\nbusinesses.  WorldCom is calling that unit the MCI Group because\\nWorldCom acquired most of that business when it bought MCI\\nCommunications Corp.  The MCI Group also includes WorldCom\\'s\\nwireless messaging and dial-up Internet access operations.\\n\\nThe other tracking stock will reflect the performance of the\\nWorldCom Group, which includes the company\\'s high-growth data,\\nInternet, international, and commercial voice businesses.  Each\\nexisting WorldCom share has been converted into one WorldCom\\nGroup tracking share and 1/25 of an MCI Group tracking share.\\n\\nBernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom\\'s president and chief executive\\nofficer, has been talking for nearly a year about separating the\\nslow-growing consumer long distance business from the faster-\\ngrowing WorldCom operations (TR, July 31, 2000).  The split was\\napproved today at a shareholders meeting in Clinton, Miss.\\n\\nThe two tracking stocks will provide \"two distinct, clear, and\\ncompelling investment opportunities,\" Mr. Ebbers said.  The MCI\\nGroup stock will pay a quarterly dividend of 60 cents per share;\\nWorldCom shares won\\'t pay a dividend.  The new shares will begin\\ntrading tomorrow on the Nasdaq stock market.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************************\\nAT&T COMPLETES CABLE MODEM `OPEN-ACCESS\\' TRIAL\\n\\nAT&T Broadband today said it had completed a six-month trial in\\nBoulder, Colo., that allowed multiple Internet service providers\\n(ISPs) to offer high-speed access over AT&T\\'s cable modem\\nplatform.  The company said it was \"on schedule\" to offer\\nconsumers their choice of cable modem ISPs by mid-2002.\\n\\nAT&T Broadband said more than 300 end-users and four ISPs\\nparticipated in the trial, which cost about $20 million.  The\\nBoulder trial will be extended for two months in a limited area\\nto continue evaluating the \"service agent\" software.  Customers\\nuse that software to register for and connect to an ISP.\\n\\nAT&T also plans to continue testing billing and customer-care\\nfeatures before launching a limited commercial program in\\nMassachusetts that will let customers choose their cable modem\\nISP.  That launch is slated for later this year.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************************\\nNEWS IN BRIEF\\n\\nThe FCC has named Marlene H.

Further, not all MA customers would show that they are getting ren=\\newables.=20\\n=20\\nF-7:  While we are very pleased with the Division's inclusion of banking, w=\\ne do not understand the need to restrict the limit on how much Supplier's a=\\nre allowed to bank as the shelf life for Renewable Energy Credits is alread=\\ny limited to the two compliance periods immediately following.  We would al=\\nso ask that you not limit the ability for Suppliers to transfer banked Rene=\\nwable Energy Credits during the allowed compliance periods.  We feel that t=\\nhe Division should encourage as much liquidity as possible in the Renewable=\\n Energy Credit market.  We understand the Division's concern regarding tran=\\nsferable banking and potential problems with market power, however, we feel=\\n that the GIS Administrator is charged with closely monitoring potential ma=\\nrket power situations.  We would prefer that the Renewable Energy Credit ma=\\nrket be allowed to operate as indicated above from the beginning and if it =\\nis determined that market power issues exist then appropriate changes to th=\\ne market can and should be implemented.

For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it. \\n\\nKerry Roper (x5-4895)\",\n",

In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site \\n(we're trying to sell it now) I have gotten Ben's authorization to secure an \\nadditional 12 month extension on the deal for $10,000.\\n\\nI spoke to the landowner - Dick Greene - and he indicated that they would \\nconsider it, although he has never been in favor of an option structure \\nsince  he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale.  The \\nconcept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension, \\nand give them an additional $5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month \\nextension on the back.  At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we \\nwould pay them another $5000.  He said he would have to hear what his lawyer \\nsaid in this regard, but I think its close to a deal.  Perhaps we could \\narrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper-Rudnick as she has dealt \\nextensively with their lawyer Ed Legner.  Its good timing to hit him now, \\nsince he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly.\\n\\nAs regards accounting issues, the total exercise price is 117 acres * $4500 / \\nac. = $526,500, and 5% = $26,325.  Total option premiums (including this \\nextension I am proposing) will be $20,000.  I believe we may also need to \\namend the original option language to make it clear that the option fee is \\nnot part of the price.\"},\n",

I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH \\nand give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the \\ndecision\\nto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island \\nproject (please, see point 2).\\n\\n2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest \\n(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island \\ntransaction. The next step\\nwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  \\nin one place and\\nto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is \\nmeeting to close a few\\nremaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.\\n\\nA few comments on the book design and my view of the project:\\n\\na. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island \\nfacility\\nby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent\\nsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term\\ncontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.\\n\\nThe fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the \\nlong-term\\ncontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are \\nsetting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal \\ncargos\\nbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and \\ncoordinating\\nthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,\\nwe have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.\\n\\nb. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension \\noption of\\n5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we\\nhave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for \\nsuch a long tenor. This is  \\nessentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread \\nand\\nI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.\\n\\nOne solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the \\nfirst\\n5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.\\n\\nc. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions\\nregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a \\nbig prudence reserve\\nin case we mark it to market.\\n\\nd. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island \\ndeal\\n(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.\\nLong-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail \\nthat \\ncorrelates very well with Brent.\\n\\n\\nVince\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Sherriff\\n05/14/2000 01:40 AM\\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT \\nSubject: LNG May 19 decision\\n\\n\\nVince\\n\\nI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  \\nAnyway with Greg moving to his\\nnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the \\nEastern Hemishere plus LNG.\\n\\nI understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for \\nLNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand\\nthat another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far \\naway).  Anway I understand this\\nis a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.

We\\nhave something called CMIS which we use for these purposes and which I\\nbelieve we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don't\\nhave something already.  We usually need customer info for reg\\nreporting purposes.\\n\\n2.\\tBob Dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of\\nsorts whereat the heads of Gas and Power Trading present to key UBSW\\npeople what their businesses are all about, example trade flows,\\ncompetitive pressures, key reg reporting requirements, etc.  He would\\nalso anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what\\nthey understand to be the developing regulations in these markets.  The\\nthought is to try and do this on Thursday because so many UBSW people\\nwill be on the ground in Houston for the simulation exercise.  I don't\\nknow that I am wedded to that day and I am a bit unsure about whether\\nthis makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration\\nbut this day may work since alot of people will already be there and I\\nam sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this\\nonce they start trading.  What do you think?\\n\\nThe audience would include key logistics personnel from UBSW and Enron\\nand anyone else you thought appropriate.  Spoke with Mike about it and\\nhe is fine.\\n\\n3.\\tHaving UBSW paraphenalia sent down - toys, shirts, etc., should\\nbe arriving by no later than Tuesday.  If you haven't received anything\\nby late on Monday could you let me know so I can track down.  UBSW and\\nUBSW Energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both\\ntrading floors - they should arrive by Wed.\\n\\n4.\\tWas thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor\\non Friday to commemorate the closing.  What do you think?\\n\\n5.\\tI am planning to be down in Houston for most of next week.  I\\nthought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to\\naddress issues as they arise in order to meet closing on Friday.  I\\nwill be leaving on a late Monday flight and returning on a late\\nafternoon Friday flight.  I hope you think this will be useful.  Please\\nlet me know otherwise.\\n\\nSorry for the long message.

I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.\\n\\nA great reflection on you guys too.\\n\\nLouise\\n\\n\\nRef: Houston Chronicle website\\n* * * * * \\nTuesday, Dec. 4 \\nI was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. \\n* * * * *  \"Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too.\"  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * \\t\\nWe have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. \\nNow it\\'s over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don\\'t work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won\\'t see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. \\nBut let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories.

I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything.  \\n\\nHowever, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of conference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs for the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team of contractors to complete this.\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tBirch, Shirley  \\nSent:\\tThursday, December 20, 2001 10:47 AM\\nTo:\\tCoffey Jr., Jim; Glover, Sheila\\nCc:\\tGruesen, Karen\\nSubject:\\tRE: information for bert stromquist\\n\\n\\tjim,\\n\\n\\tthanks so much for taking the time to reply.   the boxes were sent to bert stromquist from linda lyrock (EGEP, Inc.).  \\ti am not sure about the labeling of the boxes (HPL).  the boxes contain technical data for expl & prod for \\tinternational areas.  \\n\\n\\tbert was with enron global markets.  any ideas regarding these records will be helpful.\\n\\n\\tthanks,\\n\\n\\tshirley birch, records management\\n\\tX5-6716\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tCoffey Jr., Jim  \\nSent:\\tThursday, December 20, 2001 10:40 AM\\nTo:\\tGlover, Sheila\\nCc:\\tBirch, Shirley; Gruesen, Karen\\nSubject:\\tRE: information for bert stromquist\\n\\nNo.  We did have HPL boxes over that at one time and Carolyn Gilley and Earl Johnson managed the process but both are no longer here.

My time trial shows it takes 6 min and 45\\nseconds to deliver.  We need to cut.\\n\\nDan, can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make\\ncopies?  Send me the front end from last week\\'s filing supporting EPSA\\'s\\nmotion.\\n\\nI\\'ll take comments up to 12 noon Wednesday.\\ngba\\n=============================\\n\\n\\nThe Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) is a California non-profit trade\\nassociation of almost thirty members who sell, buy and exchange power\\nthroughout the Western U.S.  We are pleased to provide comments on the\\nfollowing areas in response to your Order issued last week.\\n\\n1. Price caps and their unintended consequences\\n\\n2. Forward scheduling, penalties, mandatory must-buy, and\\n\\n3. Independent Governing Boards.\\n\\nFirst, I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall\\ngratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order.  The members of WPTF\\nhave been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer, and\\nequally upset by the actions of non-jurisdictional parties in their\\nattempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring, and drive it into\\nthe ground. As I listened to your comments last week, I took note of all\\nthe things you said, and the stated purpose of your actions.  After\\nlistening to you, and reading the Order, I very much wanted to be here\\ntoday, even if it only afforded me a brief 5-minutes of your time.  I\\nwould have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one\\nphrase to be uttered publicly.  And that phrase would be \"Thank you.\\nThank you for taking the bold step forward to revive California\\'s\\nwholesale power market.  Thank you for having the courage to stand up to\\nparochial interests which are entirely self serving, and absent of any\\nnational policy goals.\"\\n\\nThis Commission took a stab at correcting California\\'s problems\\nutilizing several measures, one of which was a $150 price cap.  Whereas\\nwe applaud the Commission\\'s effort,  we find that price caps send the\\nwrong signal to both suppliers and load.  We have found that price caps\\nmisallocate resources, and as your Staff report demonstrates, increases\\nexports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists.  We\\nfind that price caps discourage demand-side participation, and at the\\nlevel proposed, will discourage much needed peaking generation\\nresources.  We also find that any price cap, but especially at the level\\nyou have proposed, will create unintended consequences.  For example,\\nwhen market bids exceed $150, sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or\\nthe PX.  Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a\\ncompetitive exchange to the PX, such as APX, or AlTrade?  Will the\\nliquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because\\nof an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates, and\\nabove which the bilateral market prevails?  That is a huge hammer, a\\nhuge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of\\nan hour from one trading vehicle to another.\\n\\nWPTF has been against price caps, and continues to believe that price\\ncaps do much damage, and do not protect consumers.  The damages include\\nprolonging high prices, reducing price discovery, and reducing the\\nquantity of long-term offers that otherwise would afford consumers\\nmuch-needed price protection.  Average prices do not diminish with caps,\\nin fact, as you know, August prices in California were much higher than\\nlast June, even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing\\nBoard was $250 instead of $750.\\n\\nWe recognize that the political reality is such that regulators don\\'t\\nlike price spikes, and caps are a quick solution.  If you feel that\\nprice caps must be imposed, then limit the damage.  We believe that\\nCommissioner Hebert\\'s price cap proposal which starts at $250, and\\nincrements upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the\\nleast damaging.  We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves\\nwith respect to demand, or fuel price would be the most harmful.  Market\\nparticipants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging\\nin the balance.  The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance\\nthat California needs regulatory stability, and the Commission is\\npursuing policy options to regain much needed stability.  On the other\\nhand, floating price caps work in the opposite direction.  They reek\\nhavoc because they inject more uncertainty, and lessen stability.  If\\nprice caps are at all necessary, stick to the least damaging approach.\\n\\nWPTF supports forward scheduling of demand, the imposition of real-time\\npenalties, and we support elimination of the must-buy provision embedded\\nin the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision.  Underscheduling of\\nload has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation, and\\nreduced grid reliability.  Mandatory pre-scheduling will get the ISO\\nback on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be\\nexposed to real-time resolution.  Also, by eliminating the must-buy\\nprovision, the UDCs can no longer complain about \"supply not showing\\nup\". Their avenues for finding cost-effective supply will be unlimited.\\n\\nFinally, we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with\\nindependent board members.  Whereas we have been troubled by the antics\\nof the ISO Governing Board, we must note that the PX Governing Board has\\nnot had the same type of problems. The PX Governing Board has done much\\nbetter at finding solutions to thorny problems.  But it is asking too\\nmuch, we think, to spare one and eliminate the other.  The actions of\\nthe ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the\\ncredibility of electric restructuring.  Other states eschew\\nrestructuring after observing the endless debates, the layers upon\\nlayers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO\\nGoverning Board, and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of\\nGovernors with interests totally removed from the well-being of the very\\ninstitution on whose Board they serve.\\n\\nWe are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the\\nstakeholder Governing Board may not be enough.  There may be incredible\\npressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates\\nthat further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers, but in\\nfact, are making a power grab.  My organization promises the Commission\\nthat if we suspect, if we have evidence, if we detect, or otherwise\\nobserve actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board, I\\ncan assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest.\\nThe California market simply can not survive serving two masters.  The\\njurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move\\nforward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in\\nOrders 888, and 2000.\\n\\n\\nThank you.',\n",

We have the authorized trader list for ECI and \\nare waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we \\nare prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The \\nassignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from \\nENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE \\nguaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.\\n\\nJeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the \\nSecurities Loan Agreement.

McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with\\nits main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and\\nWalnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial\\nlitigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP\\nlitigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some\\npower plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who\\nI have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that\\nChris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David\\nBalbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the\\nleading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a\\nrelationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I\\nassume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional\\ninformation.

The database \\nis sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides \\nan average volume for that criteria.

       "  'Body': \"As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  \\n\\n?\\tVoicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  \\n\\n?\\tBuilding access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.\\no\\tMonday - 5:00 AM for all employees\\n\\n?\\tSecurity & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.\\n\\n?\\tMove team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  \\no\\tRed - Move Team\\no\\tOrange - Desktop Support/IT\\no\\tGreen - Telephony\\n\\n?\\tNewspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).\\n\\n?\\tMove boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  \\n\\n?\\tMove labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.\\n\\n?\\tLaptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.\\n\\n.\\tBottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  \\n\\n?\\tPhone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building\\n\\nI hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.\\n\\nT.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd\",\n",

       "  'Body': 'SIPPING VODKA\\nA new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly\\nspeak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.\\nThe monsignor replied, \"When I am worried about getting nervous\\non the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water\\nglass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.\"\\nSo next Sunday he took the monsignor\\'s advice. At the beginning\\nof the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He\\nproceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he\\nfound the following note on the door:\\n\\n1.  Sip the Vodka, don\\'t gulp.\\n2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.\\n3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.\\n4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.\\n5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.\\n6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.\\n7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not\\nreferred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.\\n8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.\\n9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don\\'t\\nsay he was stoned off his ass.\\n10. We do not refer to the cross as the \"Big T.\"\\n11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he\\nsaid,\"Take this and eat it for it is my body.\"  He did not\\nsay, Eat me\"\\n12.  The Virgin Mary is not called \"Mary with the Cherry,\"\\n13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub\\nthanks for the grub, yeah God.\\n14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at\\nSt.Peter\\'s, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy\\'s.\\n\\n\\nThe origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings\\ngood luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the\\nchain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.\\nJust forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You\\nwill  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain\\nis not broken.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to\\nplease everyone...\"\\n- Bill Cosby...\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________\\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\\n\\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.',\n",

Nothing\\nfancy or time consuming, just a brief update\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nToday:\\n\\n          (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have to\\ndisclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998, even about\\nMarch 1998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice of\\ncounsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred ruling\\nwhether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998\\nconcerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.  (I want to find out\\nwhat this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)\\n\\n          (2)  Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort by\\nNatwest to postpone the trial in California until September.  I don't think\\nNatwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.  I am not\\nplanning for  ECT Securities to take a position.\\n\\n          (3)  We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, after\\nremoving a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch's\\nstatement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECT\\nSecurities.\\n\\nLater this week:\\n\\n        Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY.\\n I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or not\\nsay, about ECT Securities.\\n\\n\\nDo you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (and\\nalso her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enron\\nfor something concerning related party transactions?\\n\\n\\n\\nSteve Howard\\nAlschuler Grossman Stein & Kahan LLP\\nphone: 310-407-7613\\nfax: 310-552-6077\\ncell:  213-716-0536\\ne-mail:  showard@agsk.com\\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n                                                                              \\n   ................................................\\n\\nALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN & KAHAN LLP\\nATTORNEYS AT LAW\\nwww.agsk.com\\n\\n2049 Century Park East\\nThirty-Ninth Floor\\nLos Angeles, CA 90067-3213\\nTel 310-277-1226\\nFax 310-552-6077\\n\\nThis transmission is intended only for the use\\nof the addressee and may contain information\\nthat is privileged, confidential and exempt from\\ndisclosure under applicable law.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\\n\\nIndeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSloane Lamb\",\n",

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.\\n\\nBeginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: \\n\\n1.\\tPlease dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    \\n2.\\tYou will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. \\n3.\\tYou will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.\\n  \\nThis procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.\\n  \\nIf you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.\",\n",

       "  'Body': \"El Paso Proceeding with NM Pipe Integrity Testing\\n\\nEl Paso Natural Gas has received approval from the U.S. Department of \\nTransportation's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to conduct more internal \\ninspections on its rebuilt New Mexico pipeline, which ruptured August 19 \\nkilling 11 people (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22). Since the explosion, flows \\nthrough the line, which runs from West Texas to California, have been reduced \\nto 85% capacity, or about 920 MMcf/d. \\n\\nOPS said the El Paso line has already been repaired and put through \\nhydrostatic testing, which it passed. Hydrostatic testing checks for cracks \\nby forcing high-pressure water through the line. Now El Paso has the green \\nlight to begin smart pig testing, which will examine the internal integrity \\nof the line. The device, called a pig because of the sound it makes during \\ninspections, has sensors and once placed inside the line, it can detect \\ndents, deformities and changes in wall thickness. \\n\\nNeither OPS nor El Paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would \\noccur or how long it would take. However, once the testing is completed, the \\nresults will be evaluated by OPS, which then would determine if the line were \\nsafe for commercial use. \\n\\nOPS has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use, but they have become \\nincreasingly sophisticated and more widely used. Even though hydrostatic \\ntesting can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs, \\nthe pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and \\nensures more integrity in test results. \\n\\nOPS requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after \\nconstruction. Although not mandated, OPS also has proposed requiring \\npipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment \\nmethods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline's integrity. Other types of \\ninspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the \\npipe wall's thickness. \\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--\",\n",

Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western\\nResources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE\\nsubsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n\\nnamed at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, \\nWestern Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including\\nits 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into \\nWestar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.\\n\\nBased on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated\\nequity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including\\nconversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new\\nholding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western\\nResources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of\\napproximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total\\nenterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9\\nbillion in debt and preferred stock).

We deliberated whether to keep or drop AOL today,\\nbut decided to keep it.  Read on.  AOL spiked up to close\\nat $165 earlier this week and has shed $20 in the last 3\\ntrading days since.  Especially noted was the drop of $9\\nyesterday on 25 million shares (10 million more than\\naverage-not a good sign).  Today though, AOL held up well\\nin the face of strong down-market forces on lower than\\naverage volume.  It is, after all, the most stable of the\\nInternet stocks and is not going away.  While AOL feels\\ncomfortable like a family pet, remember it\\'s a trade that\\'s\\ngone against us, and normally we would get out.  But with\\nthe shaky Brazilian market perhaps drastically affecting\\nthe rest of Latin America, we think the bad news and fear\\nis already in this stock.  We think of it more like a\\nrubber band stretched in reverse where the farther it\\'s\\nstretched back, the harder it will snap forward.  It\\'s\\nnerve-racking waiting for the bounce, but AOL is a split\\ncandidate over $120 and should give us a great performance\\nonce it snaps.  With a record breaking Christmas and 22,000\\nnew users every day, AOL\\'s earnings should be great.  Look\\nfor the split announcement any day, or at the latest, with\\nearnings due Feb. 9 per Zack\\'s. (There has been some\\nconfusion on the actual date; Motley Fool board says as\\nearly as Jan. 27.  We\\'ll keep you posted.)  Still an\\nInternet-guts required.  Play with caution.\\n\\nWCOM  $71.00 $2.94 (-4.00)  In this type of trading\\nenvironment where the \"big picture\" whollops the average\\ncompany press release, it pays to sit on the sidelines.  We\\nwarned in Tuesday\\'s letter that WCOM may need to\\nconsolidate a bit before moving up, and urged discipline\\nbefore entering another trade.  We hope you waited.  WCOM\\nis still a great play, but we still need to wait for the\\nrecovery before playing this pick.  They are now at their\\n30 day moving average and should bounce off it, market\\npermitting.  $70 is their support price.  Wait for the\\nbounce.  If it breaks below $70 and holds, we\\'ll re-\\nevaluate and likely drop it.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth\\ncontent delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful\\nand more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC\\'s\\nDSL services.  Remember too, they just won the FTS2000\\ncontract (worth $5 billion)to provide the U.S. Government\\nwith voice and data services for the next 8 years\\n\\nT  $82.13 -$2.63(-$2.93)  AT&T is holding up quite well\\ngiven the market retrenchment this week.  The need to move\\nvoice and information throughout the world will not\\ndiminish, even in a down market.  AT&T could actually\\nbecome a low cost producer who benefits from cost-conscious\\nusers exercising corporate belt-tightening.  It behaves\\nlike a safe haven in a down market and a tech stock in an\\nup market.  Volume has been heavy over the last 2 days.  If\\ninvestors wanted to dump this stock, we\\'d have seen more\\ndamage to the price.  Support is at $82 with better support\\nat $80.  AT&T\\'s prospects are still great with the\\nintegration of TCI helping to complete the \"last mile\" of\\nservice availability to your home.  AT&T continues to melt\\nthe copper in favor of fiber replacement at every turn.\\nWait for the bounce and confirm market direction before\\nplaying.\\n\\nDELL  $77.63 -$1.69 (-$0.18)  Dell is holding up nicely\\nthis week given the weak market performance.  Dell\\'s volume\\nhas also been weak.  We spoke with investor relations and\\nare now able to determine that volatility has greatly\\ndiminished, and since their split in September, volume too.\\nDell used to trade 50 million shares per day on average.\\nAs the daily average is figured, the high numbers drop off\\nand new, lower numbers replace them.  This will naturally\\nreduce the average until it more closely resembles the\\nactual daily trades currently taking place.  It should not\\nbe long until these 2 more closely resemble each other.  In\\nother words, the low volume is no longer cause for alarm\\nand supports our original assessment that huge daily price\\nswings are a thing of the past.  Dell\\'s story is still the\\nsame-big sales increases, more markets served, higher\\nmargins.  When Dell\\'s news season picks up (Feb.-March\\naccording to investor relations), Dell will again be on\\ninvestors\\' radar screens.  Nothing\\'s changed; they\\'re just\\na little quieter.  Still on our favorites list, consider\\nthe slight retrenchment as a buying opportunity when the\\nmarket gets over its jitters.  Now\\'s a good time to scale\\ninto the trade, but confirm market direction first.\\n\\nLXK $97.00 3.25 (-3.56) LXK fell with the rest of the market\\non Thursday. We still like LXK with earnings coming up on\\nthe 19th of January and the strong possibility of a stock\\nsplit. The Open Buying on the Internet(OBI) standard has taken\\nanother leap forward with the adoption of Lexmark Interna-\\ntional\\'s new OBI-compliant Internet purchasing system.  The\\nKentucky-based printing solutions company has adopted a new\\nsystem that eliminates many of the manual processes Lexmark\\npreviously used to purchase indirect materials.  Lexmark\\nhas partnered with SupplyWorks, a Web-based purchasing\\nservices company.  For the first time, buyers are not required\\nto purchase software to manage supplier connections.\\n\\nLOW $51.38 -.31 (-3.31) LOW showed some nice strength today\\nwith a loss of .6%. The DOW went down over 2%. LOW was\\nlisted as one of the stocks picked in the dartboard contest.\\nWhether the professionals picking LOW is good or not is\\na decision you\\'ll have to make (just kidding). Look to last\\nSunday for why LOW is a pick.  LOW\\'s has earnings in mid-\\nFebruary.  No new news.\\n\\nATI $78.81 +1.56 (-.19) ATI bucked the trend on Thursday, and\\nwent up. Rumors continue to circulate about ATI being merged\\nwith either BellAtlantic or Vodaphone. It\\'s rumored that VOD\\nis offering in the range of $90 a share. The question now is\\nwhether Bell is willing to raise its bid to match VOD. Thursday\\'s\\nprice increase was mainly due to this speculation. Bell did\\njust get notice from the SEC that its bid would classify as\\na pooling of interests.  ATI is still $11 away from the rumored\\nbid by Vodaphone.\\n\\nLU $105.93 +1.69 (-9.32) LU is a great company, with stock\\nsplit possibilities, and earnings coming up: so why are we\\ndropping it? We aren\\'t. We have re-added LU to the pick list.\\nLast Tuesday we dropped LU because of the buyout situation\\nwith Ascend. On Wednesday, the deal went through and it seems\\nLU has finished dropping. LU opened on Wednesday at $98.50,\\nyet closed at $104.50. LU is scheduled to report earnings on\\nJanuary 21st. This date is in debate. We will try to get the\\nofficial date from LU directly. Though they are just short\\nof shares necessary to do a 2-1 stock split, they could\\nannounce a split with earnings, contingent to the vote on\\nincreasing shares in February.\\n\\nBUY CALL FEB-105 LU-BA OI=1395 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75\\nBUY CALL FEB-110 LU-BB OI=4290 at $ 6.75 SL=5.00\\nBUY CALL APR-110 LU-DB OI=2978 at $11.25 SL=8.50\\nBUY CALL APR-115 LU-DC OI=3300 at $ 9.00 SL=6.50\\n\\n\\nXIRC $38.13 .50 (-.37) XIRC has held up pretty well through\\nthis market debacle.  Earnings are on January 21st and XIRC\\nhas announced earnings with surprises of no less than 10% over\\nthe last four quarters.  This normally will help XIRC to have\\nan earnings run into the announcement. XIRC\\'s 10-dma is at\\n$37.00. Watch for upward movement before initiating new plays.\\n\\n\\n\\nPICK NEWS - PUTS\\n******************\\n\\nPUT PICK NEWS WAS NOT AVAILABLE BY PRESS TIME DUE TO\\nTECHNICAL PROBLEMS AT PINNACLE.\\n\\n\\n\\n******************\\nNEW CALL PLAYS\\n******************\\n\\nCOF  Capital One Financial $127.18 1.18 (-.12 for this week)\\n\\nCapital One Financial, a financial services holding company,\\nis the parent for Capital One Bank, one of the US\\'s top 10\\ncredit card companies.

With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,\\nand its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from\\ncustomers among the telephone companies, cable operators,\\nand government agencies.  Though they faded from news of\\ntheir failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player.\\n\\nTLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 11 million shares,\\n$8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.  We thought\\nit would quickly fall back; we were wrong.  TLAB drifted back\\nto $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.\\nOver the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weakness\\nwhile giving back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright\\nbearish market-a terrific sign of strength.  Technical\\nindicators are positive, so is the chart indicating a small\\ncorrection already taking place.  3.5 million shares traded\\ndaily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash;\\n34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   TLAB will be a\\nwinner when the market turns.  We expect them to announce more\\ncontracts in the coming weeks.  Recent news is capturing\\ninvestors\\' eyeballs, making for a good story.\\n\\nHere goes.

Recently, It has\\nadded an internet portal in a joint venture with Infoseek, in\\nwhich it has a 43% stake.\\n\\nThe past year has been tough for Disney, due to high\\nprogramming costs at its ABC division, and to weak demand for\\nits products in Asia.  Last week Merrill Lynch\\'s Jessica\\nReif Cohen lowered earnings estimates for the current fiscal\\nquarter from .27 to .23, and for the fiscal year ending Sept.\\n1999 from .91 to .86. She cited softness in consumer products\\nand broadcasting operations, and continued weakness in Asia.\\nHowever, three other analysts believe the stock is oversold\\nand that DIS is experiencing a recovery.

By mid-morning, stocks were on the rebound,\\nlifted by a recovery in Brazil and massive bargain hunting. By\\nnoon, the panic was gone and many traders were selling partial\\npositions to lock-in gains. At the close, the Dow fell 125 points\\nto 9349.56 and recouped more than half its early losses. Even so,\\nthe decline was viewed as a reminder of market vulnerability after\\na series of record highs.\\n\\nOur portfolio was very active. We will begin with the new plays:\\nLU was the focus of our attention and it dropped hard with the\\nrest of the high visibility techs. The stock traded as low as $96\\nbut the first option prices available for the FEB105C/110C left\\nus with a debit of $1.75. Morgan Stanley raised its rating of LU\\nto a \"strong buy\" late in the morning and that helped the stock\\nmove higher through the day. LUV was the next offering and it was\\nalso significantly lower at the open. The first few trades on the\\nFEB22C/25C went through at about $1.25 debit. LEVL was far less\\naffected by the morning activity and the best we could do on the\\nFEB30C/35C was $3.25 debit. DIS was our personal play-of-the-day\\nand we managed to trade along with everyone else (fighting the\\noverwhelmed internet brokerages) with a $4.00 opening cost-basis\\nfor the JAN00-40C/FEB40C LEAPS/Calendar spread.\\n\\nIn other portfolio plays; It was a great opportunity to double-up\\n(reducing the cost-basis) on some of the more favorable debit\\npositions. AOL and OXHP were our candidates and these stocks were\\ndown at the open. The prices were: AOL, FEB155C/160C at $1.50 and\\nOXHP, FEB17C/20C at $1.00. We will reflect these separate trades\\nin the monthly summary. Of course, some of the calendar spreads\\nwere in need of a correction and we used the opportunity to pare\\nlosses from the recent run-up. Short positions were closed on:\\nATI; JAN70C at $7.00, GM; JAN70C at $11.00, and PCS; JAN22C at\\n$2.38.\\n\\nT was quite a mover! In the morning melee, we purchased the JAN80C\\nat $2.50 (with the stock price near $82) and subsequently closed\\nthe FEB80C during the midday rebound for $8.50.\\n\\nOne other opportunity arose on the NXTL straddle. The MAY35P could\\nhave been closed for $5.25, leaving the long (call) option; MAY30C\\nat cost of $2.87.\\n\\nJanuary 14, 1999 update\\n\\nU.S. stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as the impeachment trial\\nagainst the President added pressure to an already shaken market.\\nPolitical instability is a catalyst for investor uncertainty and\\nthat was evident as the DJIA fell 228 points to 9120, erasing all\\nthe big gains for 1999. The Nasdaq Composite Index was also lower,\\ndown 40 points at 2276. Stocks have been poised for a downturn\\nfollowing the recent run-up in prices but some thought the strong\\nU.S. economy would protect the stock market from the impeachment\\ndrama. However, the trial opened in an investment climate that had\\nalready been shaken by the devaluation of Brazil\\'s currency and\\njittery investors flocked to the exits.\\n\\nOn Thursday, we used the morning bounce to fill some of our open\\ncalendar positions: On ATI, we rolled up to the FEB75C at a bid\\nprice of $7.25; GM was also moved to a diagonal spread with the\\nsale of the FEB75C for $8.50 and PCS was moved to the next higher\\nstrike with a FEB25C at $2.87. These spreads are no longer neutral\\nand are now more aggressive with the new strike positions but we\\nexpect all of these stocks to remain at-or-above current prices.\\n\\nFor Friday, we still have a number of suspect issues. CPQ and CD\\nare near the sold strikes and we may need to close those positions\\nbefore the day is over. FTU is fading as the merger speculation\\ndwindles and LU is still \"one to watch\" as the ASND deal unfolds\\nand the company earnings report aproaches. Good Luck!\\n\\n\\n\\n    - NEW PLAYS -\\n******************************************************************\\nCIEN - Ciena Corp.  $18.68     Merger Speculation\\n\\nCIENA Corporation designs, manufactures and sells architecture,\\ndense wavelength division multiplexing systems for fiberoptic\\ncommunications networks.

Who is next??\\n\\n\\nAnother day, another excuse for profit taking. The market sold off\\nagain with the Brazilian flu along with a dose of impeachment blues.\\n\\nThe market started down early and showed little interest in turning\\naround. The rumors from Brazil were all negative. Coupled with the\\nresignation of yet another government official the rumor that the\\nCentral Bank was set to let the Real float knocked the Brazil market\\nfor another -10% loss. Floating the Real, the Brazilian currency,\\nwould be a drastic devaluation since the currency would then be free\\nto find its own level.\\n\\nFloating could start the domino theory fall of all the surrounding\\nLatin American countries that depend on Brazil for trade. Chile and\\nArgentina would be the first to go. If South America were to devalue\\nas a group then the countries who export to South America would be\\nput on a diet. The U.S., depending on who you talk to and what area\\nthey reference, exports to South America account for between 17-25%\\nof our total. Companies like Colgate derive 40% of their revenue from\\nLatin countries.\\n\\nIf the feared event happened then the results would be drastic. The\\ncompanies who derive a large percentage of their business from there\\nwould suffer huge earnings shortfalls. Layoffs could occur, plant\\nclosings, etc. That would be the extreme but it is possible. Possible\\nbut not probable. There are many things that can and will happen\\nbefore we get to that point. Rest assured that every Fed head in the\\nworld is concerned about the Brazil problem. The IMF will be very\\ninterested in preventing this scenario. Cardosa is very interested.\\nPower and pressure are being brought to bear. The Brazil Central\\nBank issued a strongly worded press release stating they would use\\nevery means at their disposal to prevent floating the Real. They\\nsaid they would use their $50 bln in reserves to protect the Real.\\nThis was only minimally comforting to the market this afternoon.\\nMemories of many other countries last minute claims to the same\\nintent, and then immediate devaluation, are fresh. Russia was the\\nlatest. While analysts feel there could be serious impacts from a\\npossible worst case, they also feel that the market has now discounted\\nthe most likely scenario which is months of protracted, painful,\\nnegotiations ending in an agreement of some sort to yet another bail\\nout. No harm, no foul. Just uncertainty.\\n\\nMeanwhile the market has now \"corrected\" five percent off its record\\nhigh of just last week. My how short our memory can be. 9643, only\\nfive trading days ago. Champagne was already being ordered for the\\nDow 10,000 celebration. Should we cancel the order? Not hardly.\\n\\nAs I have said many times the market cycles. Remember last week when\\nI kept warning you about an impending bout of profit taking. Its\\'\\nhere and I don\\'t think it is over. Fear of darkness is only beaten\\nout by one other thing. Fear of a long holiday weekend. Yep, closed\\nMonday for MLK day. I have already had one of my brokers call me to\\nask if I want some currency positions left open over the long weekend.\\nSeems the currency market closes at 1:PM on Friday. Now if you were\\na country that needed to manipulate some currency to benefit your\\ncountry, a U.S. holiday would be the perfect time. Don\\'t laugh.\\nJapan does it all the time. The same thing on a smaller scale can\\nhappen to stock profits held over a holiday. Events happen, mass\\nexodus at Tuesday\\'s open. Remember Wednesday morning?\\n\\nYou may think I have put on a fur coat. Far be it from the truth.\\nI am long several hundred contracts of tech stocks and I am looking\\nfor a recovery soon. Again, being long does not make me right, just\\nvery interested in the outcome.\\n\\nI have not elaborated on the market impact from the impeachment trial\\nand won\\'t because I don\\'t think there is any impact. As I have said\\nbefore, the chances of a guilty vote are about zero and the market\\nknows this.\\n\\nIf you watched any market TV today then you know the Internet stocks\\nare finally starting to weave. They are getting beat from all sides.\\nBrokers are cutting the ratings on the high flyers left and right.\\nFunny how the smell of blood brings out the crowd. Nobody would cut\\nthem last week when they were adding $20 a day. It is dogpile time\\nnow. To add insult to injury the online brokers are now starting\\nto prevent customers from actually buying the stocks. I am not\\nkidding. Some have taken them off the margin list. If you want to\\nbuy you have to pay cash, 100%. Others will not let you buy them\\nonline. You have to call a broker and wait on the line while they\\nverify your eligibility to purchase high risk investments! Others\\nrefuse to execute the trades at all. You might hurt yourself. Does\\nit strike you strange that Internet brokers will not let you buy\\nInternet stocks??? What ever happened to the concept of \"it is\\nyour money not theirs.\" In the face of this conspiracy to protect\\nyou from yourself the Internets are losing ground quickly. Except\\nAOL. AOL has somehow avoided the label of \"overpriced\" and actually\\ngarnered several honorable mentions from analysts downgrading other\\nInternet stocks. Guess where Internet money will go now?\\n\\nFor you technicians out there the pendulum has swung from\\noverbought to oversold in a very short period of time. The Dow\\nis now down -522 points in the last five days. Both the Dow and\\nthe Nasdaq have corrected about 5%. Just as the sharp run up last\\nweek was begging for a dip, this sharp dip is now begging for a\\nrally. The big drop today was on the lightest Dow volume in over\\na week. Not as much conviction today just a lack of buyers. This\\nwas also the third triple digit loss in a row. As I mentioned\\nearlier I think the odds for a down day Friday are still pretty\\ngood. The wild card again is the options expiration which normally\\nprovides an upward bias. I can\\'t build a case for a strong move\\nupward because of Brazil and the holiday but I can see a strong\\nTuesday coming as long as Brazil does not meltdown over the weekend.\\nEarnings will be on us in earnest next week with MSFT, LU, SUNW\\nannouncing along with dozens of others. I think the focus on\\nBrazil will have dimmed and the anticipation of upside surprises\\nwill take center stage.\\n\\nGood Luck\\n\\nJim Brown\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket Posture\\n*******************************************************\\nAs of Market Close - Thursday, January 14, 1999\\n\\n                   Major Support\\nBroad Market         /Resistance    Last    Posture/Since  Alert\\n****************************************************************\\n\\nDOW Industrials    9,400   9,730   9,121    BEARISH   1.14 *\\nSPX S&P 500        1,200   1,280   1,212    Neutral   1.12\\nOEX S&P 100          580     635     601    Neutral   1.12\\nRUT Russell 2000     400     435     420    Neutral   1.12\\n\\nNDX NASD 100       1,900   2,010   1,906    Neutral   1.08\\nMSH High Tech        870     980     931    Neutral   1.08\\n\\n                   Major Support\\nTechnology           /Resistance    Last    Posture/Since  Alert\\n****************************************************************\\nXCI Hardware         800     875     836    Neutral   1.08\\nCWX Software         600     665     619    Neutral   1.08\\nSOX Semiconductor    360     400     392    Neutral   1.08\\nNWX Networking       400     450     427    Neutral   1.08\\nINX Internet         425     570     474    Neutral   1.08\\n\\n                   Major Support\\nFinancial            /Resistance    Last    Posture/Since  Alert\\n****************************************************************\\nBIX Banking          660     710     647    BEARISH   1.14 *\\nXBD Brokerage        545     725     638    Neutral   1.14 *\\nIUX Insurance        600     620     588    BEARISH   1.14 *\\n\\n                   Major Support\\nOther                /Resistance    Last    Posture/Since  Alert\\n****************************************************************\\nRLX Retail           800     860     814    Neutral   1.08\\nDRG Drug             720     795     740    Neutral   1.08\\nHCX Healthcare       710     780     726    Neutral   1.08\\nXAL Airline          310     350     312    Neutral   1.12\\nOIX Oil & Gas        245     260     240    BEARISH   1.14 *\\n\\n\\n\\nPosture Alert\\n\\nAfter tumbling more than 350 points over the past two days, we\\nhave turned BEARISH across the Dow Jones 30 and select\\nindustry sectors including Banking, Insurance and Oil & Gas.\\n\\nA detailed description of our Market Posture and its\\napplications can be found at:\\n\\nwww.optioninvestor.com/marketposture\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors\\n******************************************************************\\n\\nStay Focused on the Pinnacle Index\\n\\nAfter selling off precipitously over the past couple of days, it\\nis very important to keep in eye on the Pinnacle Index and other\\nput/call ratios for clues as to whether the sell-off is a major\\nreversal or profit taking.\\n\\nBased upon the early returns, it appears that most option\\nspeculators are viewing the sell-off as profit taking and this\\ncould be prove BEARISH over the near-term.

Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.\\nWe drop a pick because something happened to change its\\nprofile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we\\ndon\\'t want anyone else starting a new play at that time.\\nWe have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are\\nunfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we\\nwant them to look at any current pick as a valid play.\\n\\n\\nCALLS:\\n******\\n\\nCMGI $105.00 -8.44 (+40.75) After being derailed by the\\nBrazilian devaluation bomb midweek, the market when into\\na tailspin and the Internets were no exception.  After\\nMonday\\'s earth shaking surge of $71.75, CMGI has dwindled\\naway 31 points in the last 3 days ($62 pre-split).  With\\na host of downgrades raining down on several of the big\\nhitters in the Internet sector, we figure it is time to\\ndodge the bullet before some valuation happy analyst sets\\ntheir sights on CMGI.  We are cutting CMGI loose and\\nhopefully it\\'s consolidation will be quick.\\n\\nAMZN $138.00 -10.00 (-22.25)  Brazilian devaluation.\\nAnalysts\\' downgrades due to valuation.  Bearish short-term\\nremarks.  Impeachment proceedings.  Option expirations.  What\\nelse can we add to the mixture in this pot of volatility??\\nAmazon had been doing just fine when it popped up over +$75.00\\nlast week.  Not this week!  On Thursday in a sign of weakness,\\nAmazon finished only two and a half points off its low for the\\nday to close at $138.00.  Even earnings reports from companies\\nsuch as Yahoo that beat estimates weren\\'t enough to carry\\nsympathy plays like Amazon into positive territory.  We are\\ndropping Amazon as a pick.  This is not to say that Amazon\\nwon\\'t turn around- and soon.  But in light of current\\ncircumstances, we feel there are safer plays to be in.\\n\\nASND $82.13 +1.81 (+10.69) We finally got the price that LU is\\npaying for ASND, and it is .825 shares of LU for each share of\\nASND.  The reason we are dropping ASND is because it has\\neffectively turned into a LU play since the purchase price has\\nbeen announced.  There is a little more room for ASND to move\\ngiven the share ratio, but typically the acquiree does not\\nclose the gap completely because of the uncertainty of the deal\\nbeing closed.  There is no hint of competing bids, but ASND\\nwould be a current play again if a bidding war started for it.\\n\\nSLR $83.56 -1.50(-6.07) We are dropping SLR with the idea\\nwe might pick it back up closer to the earnings report and\\nstock split date. As predicted, SLR announced a 2-1 stock\\nsplit this week. They announced after close on Wednesday.\\nUnfortunately, with the market volatility, SLR went down on\\nthe day. We did see an opening that sent SLR up a few dollars,\\nbut this faded into a loss by days end. SLR could definitely\\nsee a split and earnings run, but we feel it\\'s better to wait\\nfor confirmation.\\n\\nJPM  $102.00 4.56 (-12.44) The comeback in financial stocks\\nwas derailed this week.  Hammered by the problems in Brazil,\\nJPMorgan lost another $4.56 today.  When we initiated this\\nplay, JPM had momentum and its chart looked good.  However,\\nit\\'s exposure to Brazil is too great, and given the seriousness\\nof the political and economic troubles in that country, we\\nhave to drop JPM as a play.\\n\\nGDT  $103.63  3.38 (-3.37) Guidant has lost ground since\\nsetting an intra-day high of $119.75 on Monday. With just\\n13 days to go before it splits, GDT should be cruising into\\na split run. It tried on Monday, but weakness in the overall\\nmarket has held it back. If the market turns positive again,\\nso will Guidant.  However, with the questionable market\\nfooting we are going to cut Guidant loose until things firm up\\n\\n\\n\\nPUTS:\\n******\\n\\nNONE\\n\\n\\n\\nPICK NEWS - CALLS\\n*******************************************************\\n\\nFTL  $17.06 -.06 (-1.44)  FTL was added as a possible take\\nover play this week.  Something is going on but what?  We\\nare constantly pouring over news and rumor mongers only to\\ndiscover on Wednesday morning wires, trading was halted for\\na block of shares (73,100) to trade at $16.06 down $-1.56.\\nThen we read about 100,000 shares being crossed by\\nGoldman Sachs.  Plus another 100,000 was traded at $17 today\\nby Salomon Smith Barney.  Unlike the techs\\' FTL did not suffer in\\ntodays\\' trading, opening $17.69, taking a little off the table\\nto $16.69 then closing at $17.06.  Not providing a great\\nwarm a fuzzy feeling, but enough of a feeling to keep this\\nas a play.  Remember, rumors are predicting a buyout at $23\\nor more.\\n\\nMYG $63.25 -0.69 (-0.75)  Between Tuesday and Wednesday, MYG\\nseemed to be holding its own and only lost thirty-one cents\\nas the market dropped a combined -270.33 points.  But\\nBrazilian woes continued and the market plummeted another\\n-228.63 on Thursday.  Maytag fought and fought but finally,\\nthe market scored a point with a knock-down.  Maytag was\\nstunned and conceded -$0.69.  MYG is normally a strong play\\nand is still one of our split candidates.  But, the market\\nis extremely volatile and we suggest waiting for things to\\nturn around before starting any new plays.\\n\\nSUNW $94.50 -2.31 (+3.62)  Sun is one of the brightest stocks\\non Wall Street even though the Brazilian storm continues to\\ndarken the market.  Sun is up +$3.62 on the week from positive\\npress releases and rumors of a possible take-over by IBM.  On\\nWednesday, CNBC presented the rumor which ended up being\\ndismissed as smoke but option trade volume increased none the\\nless.  We will keep you posted of any changes in the scenario.\\nIn other news, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its 12-month\\nprice target for SUNW to $132, up from the previous price of\\n$104.  Not only does Sun have the only end to end computing\\nplatform used in telecommunications services, it is also\\nworking on incorporating its Java technology into the digital\\nTV industry.  Even though SUNW got ruffled by the market and\\ndropped -$2.31 on Thursday, SUNW is still a strong play.\\nEarnings for the company are scheduled for Jan 21st (not the\\n15th as we had previously reported), a prime time to announce\\na possible split.  Look at the additional dip as a buying\\nopportunity but wait for some signs of a turn around before\\nentering.  Trying to catch a falling knife tends to damage\\nfingers and trading capital.\\n\\nEMC $93.88 +1.56 (+.31) EMC is a pretty amazing momentum stock.\\nThe NASDAQ is down 1.7% today, and EMC goes up.  On Wednesday,\\nEMC\\'s gap down went as low as $84, but it was such a fast\\nmarket it probably was not a price you could have gotten\\neasily.  During the first 15 minutes of trading on Wednesday\\n1 million shares were traded.  This was almost half of\\nWednesday\\'s volume, and one-third of EMC\\'s average daily\\nvolume. There hasn\\'t been any news on EMC, but then again, it\\ndoesn\\'t look like we need any.  FYI  In our Sunday write-up we\\nhad EMC\\'s earnings release date as 1/28, but we have since\\nlearned that the release date is either 1/25 or 1/26.\\n\\nJBL $71.31 -.69 (-3.56) JBL held up pretty well today\\nconsidering the action in the market.  I am sure that the\\ncoverage initiated on JBL by Everen Securities helped.  The\\npress release did note, however, that in the near-term they\\nbelieve that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long term\\nit should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that\\nprobably helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one\\nstock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this\\nindustry tends to move together, but JBL appears to be the\\nupper crust of a volatile group.\\n\\nUTX $108.56 2.31 (-6.13) UTX is very Dow sensitive.  Let\\'s\\nillustrate it.  The Dow is down 2.3% today and UTX was down\\n2.1%.  It has been that way all week.  The only thing at this\\npoint that would probably change UTX\\'s price movement is a pre-\\nearnings announcement one way or the other.  UTX announces\\nearnings next week.  On the news side, we are amazed at the\\nnumber of varied businesses of UTX.  For example, today UTX\\nannounced that its Hamilton Standard unit signed a letter of\\nintent to joint venture with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to focus\\non the maintenance of pneumatic aircraft components.  In the\\npress release it indicated that it\\'s Hamilton unit also makes\\nspace suits for the NASA shuttle program.  Only play UTX if the\\nDow is moving up.\\n\\nMSFT  $141.75 -$2.06 (-8.13)  Like we said, don\\'t try to\\ncatch a falling knife.  Though, we shrugged off an ugly\\nbeginning to finish over 1 point positive yesterday, today\\nwe gave it back, and then some.  We\\'re still positive on\\nMSFT given their trial has begun to produce positive news,\\nlike their appeal of the Judge\\'s decision to force MSFT to\\nuse Sun\\'s version of Java in its Windows operating system,\\nand a new stream of MSFT-friendly witnesses on the stand.\\nFurthermore, Prudential Securities said analyst Doug Crooke\\ninitiated coverage of Microsoft Corp. with a rating of\\naccumulate and a price target of $175 a share.  MSFT is\\nstill a split candidate at over $140 and will announce\\nearnings January 19 after the close.  We realize that\\ntrading options is inherently risky and caution to wait for\\na reversal in the stock and the overall market before\\nstarting another play.  If it falls another day, let it\\nfall.  The point is to catch a good entry on the way up,\\nnot on the way down.\\n\\n\\n***** Play updates continued in section two *****\\n\\n\\n\\nFREE TRIAL READERS\\n******************\\nIf you like the results you have been receiving we\\nwould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.\\n\\nThe monthly subscription price is 39.95.

Ray\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Ray Alvarez/TRANSREDES on 02/07/2001 \\n09:39 AM ---------------------------\\n\\nSteve Hopper\\n02/07/2001 08:47 AM\\n\\nTo: Ricky Lynn Waddell/SA/Enron@Enron, John Novak/SA/Enron@Enron, Laine A \\nPowell/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Peter E Weidler/NA/Enron@Enron, \\nRay Alvarez/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Doug Farmer/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Dave Barry\\'s thoughts on CA\\'s electrical storage\\n\\n\\nFeb. 2, 2001, 8:06PM\\n\\nThe rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite \\n\\nBy DAVE BARRY  \\n\\nWhen we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  \\nreaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  \\n\\nNo, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  \\nhappens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, \\ncell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley \\nMacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new \\nand  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the \\nnation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage \\nand see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and \\nchange the  subject.  \\n\\nOur first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  \\nMicrosoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that \"electricity\" is defined  as a \\n\"class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from \\nthe interaction of charges.\" What does this mean, in lay-person\\'s  terms?  \\n\\nIt means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  \\ndope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  \\nelectricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  \\none-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside \\na  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  \\n\\nElectrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  \\nproved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during \\na  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin \\nwent on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a \\nhoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing \\nsomersaults in a  thunderstorm.  \\n\\nFinally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  \\nPooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no \\nchoice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, \\nFranklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity \\noriginates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted \\nto the earth by golfers.  \\n\\nAfter entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when \\ndug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called \"generators,\"  \\nturns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of \"volts\"  (also \\nknown as \"watts,\" or \"rpm\" for short) through special  wires with birds \\nsitting on them to consumers\\' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into \\ncommercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the \\nground, thus completing what is known as a \"circuit.\"  \\n\\nBut enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  \\nelectricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don\\'t have  \\nenough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people\\'s  \\nhearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, \\nscuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout \"CLEAR!\" as they  \\ntouch the patient\\'s chest.  \\n\\nWho is responsible for California\\'s electricity shortage? You could blame \\nthe  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could \\nblame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of \\nelectricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson\\'s Creek; \\nor you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be \\nwrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity \\nshortage is:  college students.  \\n\\nI base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  \\nstudent, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son \\nis  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- \\nevery  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. \\n-- will be  running. My son doesn\\'t even have to turn the devices on; they \\nactivate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  \\n\\nNow take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  \\nCalifornia, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number \\nof  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: \\nPlease  insert my point).  \\n\\nThe question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow \\ncountrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare \\nelectricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this \\ngreat and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them \\ntogether, forming a  giant electrical \"chain of helping\" across the fruited \\nplain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous \\nsmoking lumps of  carbon, that\\'s what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. \\nThis involves building a  really, really, really big kite.  \\n\\nKnight-Ridder Tribune',\n",

We will enclose the pledge form and=20\\nan Enron matching gifts form for your convenience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur meeting with Bob May, Dean of the McCombs School of Business at=20\\nUT-Austin, was a great success.  We had 14 attendees who received an update=\\n=20\\nfrom Bob about the many great things going on in Austin, as well as=20\\nopportunities to participate in the =01&We=01,re Texas=018 capital campaign=\\n.\\n\\nAfter Bob=01,s presentation, the 14 Enron officers met separately and were=\\n=20\\nextremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner=\\n=20\\nto the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in=20\\ngiving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!\\n\\nHere is what we propose and how it would work.\\n\\n1. The UT Alumni at Enron would pledge $1 million over four years to the=20\\nMcCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and=\\n a=20\\nmatching $500,000 from Enron.\\n\\n2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business=\\n=20\\nSchool would match the $1 million.\\n\\n3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million =01&Enron Chair=018=\\n to=20\\nsupport =01&star quality=018 faculty for the school.  This will represent o=\\nne of=20\\nthe largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.\\n\\nA few additional details:\\n\\n1. Each individual=01,s contribution will also be credited to their name (a=\\nlong=20\\nwith the Enron match) for recognition purposes in Business School=01,s Annu=\\nal=20\\nReport, President=01,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribu=\\ntion=20\\nmatched by Enron will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that=20\\nindividual for recognition purposes.\\n\\n2. Enron has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann=\\nual=20\\nmatching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in =\\na=20\\nway that makes it a part of the =01&Enron Chair=018.\\n\\n3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the =01&=\\nWe=01,re=20\\nTexas=018 campaign as long as that pledge is not supporting a separately na=\\nmed=20\\ncontribution.  Please let us know that this is your intent.\\n\\nPlease carefully consider this request.  I do not plan to finalize the pled=\\nge=20\\nuntil I receive responses from enough officers to support this contribution=\\n. =20\\nWe have about 40 officers of Enron who are UT alumni and with some=20\\nparticipation by each of us, we will achieve this level of gift.  Our plans=\\n=20\\nare to follow this up with a broader opportunity for all Enron employees th=\\nat=20\\nare UT alumni; however, the leadership of the group will determine our=20\\nsuccess.\\n\\nThanks for your consideration and continuing support of The University of=\\n=20\\nTexas.'},\n",

The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  \\n\\nPlease call or e-mail with your comments.\\n\\nThanks so much,\\n\\nSteve\"},\n",

       "  'Body': \"According to facilities the 4th floor of Three Allen will be available starting April 1st.  I just finished a walk through of the space and have the following comments about possibly moving HPL on to the floor:\\n\\nIt is a mezzanine type floor which has overhangs which are open to the elevator lobby down below.  We'd need to stick trading and logistics into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise.\\n\\nThere are currently only 70 ports or network connections on the floor.  We'd need to pull additional cable to handle the approximately 150 people that would need to be on the floor.  If we decide so to use the floor we could get this done within a couple of weeks at most. \\n\\nThe floor is set up with mostly offices and very few cubes.  We'd need to put together several people in each office to fit everyone into the space.  If we put more than one person in the office the fire code we require us to put a strobe in each office set up this way.\\n\\nThere is no telecom or wiring closet on the floor.  That means to make this work as is HPL would have to remain on our network and depend on us for telecom service via our Nortel switch during the stay in Three Allen since there would be nowhere for AEP to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out.  There is no set up for the IPC Trader phones and currently no room to add an IPC rack on the 5th floor telecom closet.  We would have to either knock out a wall on the 5th floor closet or tell the traders to live without recorded phone conversations.\\n\\nThe good news is that Keith Dziadek and his team have figured out a way to make the EOL connection with AEP work that will have minimal impact to EOL.  We could use this link for HPL to access their Trade Blotter, Risk Systems and People Soft from AEP.\\n\\nBottom Line:  \\nThe space on 4 is not ideal but it is available.  I will be receiving a floor plan today and will kindly forward a copy on to someone within your group to work with Bill Donovans group to see if there is anyway to get 150 people on the floor.  There will be some costs to set things up like additional cabling and installing some additional desks or workstations.  If we decide that trader phones are necessary then we would have to expand the 5th floor wiring closet.  If we decide to do this we may need to purchase an IPC switch, system and phones.  It cost me $60,000 when I purchased an IPC system for Bridgeline.  I will also check to see if we have a switch anywhere that we could borrow for a few months. \\n\\nWe need to decide very quickly if this is what we want to do if we are shooting for having people over in Three Allen for the April Bid Week for May production.  We also need to talk about this additional cost with AEP and having them pick some or all of it up.  We also need to have AEP on board because they are building their side of the interfaces with our systems.  If the interfaces are not ready in time then the traders would need to enter trades into both Sitara and AEP's Risk System.  The bigger issue would be the interface with AEP's PeopleSoft system since they would be generating payments via this application.  The good news is that May production for physical trades will not settle until June giving them extra time to finish the interface.  Our side of the interfaces are pretty simple and I feel confident we will be ready to test in April.  \\n\\nLet me know if you need any additional information.  -  Tommy\"},\n",

In the deal, Enron will\\nprovide both gas and electric commodities to Hades\\' facilities throughout\\nand under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy\\nmonopolist\\nStandard Oil, is now head of Hades\\' energy management division.  Said\\nRockefeller, \"Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal\\nflames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel\\nresources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my\\nboss, and, as a former monopolist, I just\\nlike the way they do business.\"  A spokesperson for Enron said the two\\ncultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According\\nto the company, \"The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With\\nHades\\' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a\\nfabulous\\ngrowth opportunity for millennia to come.\"  According to several energy\\nindustry insiders, Hades\\' high heating demand with very little need for\\nsummer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.\\nHades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide\\nand approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained\\nhigh growth rates over the last two thousand years.  Enron is one of the\\nworld\\'s leading energy and communications companies.  The company owns\\napproximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron\\nranks in the top quarter of Fortune\\'s \"Best 100 Companies to Work For\\nif You Can Keep A Job There and Don\\'t Mind Working 80 Hours A Week,\" and\\nis among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers\\nwith respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________________\\nThis message, together with any attachments, is intended only for the\\nuse of the individual or entity to which it is addressed and may contain\\ninformation that is legally privileged, confidential and exempt from\\ndisclosure.

Thomas Beach. I am principal consultant with the firm=20\\nCrossborder\\nEnergy. My business address is 2560 Ninth Street, Suite 316, Berkeley,=20\\nCalifornia 94710.  My\\nexperience and qualifications are described in Attachment RTB-1 to the dire=\\nct=20\\ntestimony that I\\nserved in this proceeding on May 4, 2000.\\n\\n\\nI.   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     This rebuttal testimony responds to the direct testimony of the Southe=\\nrn=20\\nCalifornia\\nGeneration Coalition (SCGC) and The Utility Reform Network (TURN) in suppor=\\nt=20\\nof their \"Post-\\nInterim Settlement Agreement\" (PISA), which was submitted to the Commission=\\n=20\\non April 3,\\n2000.  The sponsors of this rebuttal testimony include past, present, and=\\n=20\\nfuture electric generation\\ncustomers of the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) and San Diego G=\\nas=20\\nand Electric\\n(SDG&E).  The sponsors of this testimony are all signatories to and=20\\nsupporters of the\\nComprehensive Settlement Agreement that over 20 parties filed on April 17,=\\n=20\\n2000.  For the\\nreasons set forth below, the sponsors of this testimony do not support the=\\n=20\\nSCGC / TURN PISA\\nto the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission, a step tha=\\nt=20\\nis one of \"the most\\npromising options\" that the Commission has identified for the restructuring=\\n=20\\nof the SoCalGas\\nsystem.  I recommend, instead, that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive=\\n=20\\nSettlement\\nAgreement, which moves forward on all of the Commission\\'s \"most promising=\\n=20\\noptions,\" including\\nunbundling intrastate transmission.  The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement=\\n=20\\nenjoys broad\\nsupport from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern=20\\nCalifornia gas market.\\n\\n\\nII.  SCGC / TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PG&E\\n     AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS.\\n\\n     In D. 99-07-015, at page 14, the Commission identified the creation of=\\n a=20\\nsystem of firm,\\ntradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its \"most promising=20\\noptions\" for the further\\nrestructuring of the SoCalGas system.  A significant element in that=20\\ndetermination was the\\nCommission\\'s desire to follow the model of the PG&E Gas Accord, and thus to=\\n=20\\nencourage\\nstatewide consistency in its gas restructuring program.  The SCGC / TURN PI=\\nSA=20\\nnow asks the\\nCommission to re-consider that finding, and to defer any further unbundling=\\n=20\\nof intrastate\\ntransmission service on the SoCalGas system.  In support of that aspect of=\\n=20\\nthe PISA, the\\nwitnesses for SCGC / TURN testify (1) that the unbundled transmission syste=\\nm=20\\nadopted for\\nPG&E under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n=\\not=20\\nbeen present in\\nsouthern California, (2) that there are significant structural and=20\\noperational differences between\\nthe PG&E and SoCalGas systems, and (3) that the Gas Accord structure has no=\\nt=20\\nbenefitted end-\\nuse customers in northern California.  None of these assertions are correct=\\n.\\n\\n     A.   The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide, Consistent Structure=\\n=20\\nfor the\\n          Gas Utilities Moving Forward, Not on Whether PG&E and SoCalGas Ha=\\nve\\n          Had Similar Problems in the Past.\\n\\n     SCGC / TURN witness Mr. Florio describes at length the problems that l=\\ned=20\\nto the\\nadoption on transmission unbundling for PG&E in the Gas Accord settlement. =\\n=20\\nHe views PG&E\\'s\\ndifficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces, thus=\\n=20\\njustifying more\\n\"extreme measures\" such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission.  SCGC=\\n /=20\\nTURN Testimony,\\nat Section 2.1.1.2.\\n\\n     In my view, both PG&E and SoCalGas have faced the same types of=20\\nproblems, even if the\\neconomic distortions on the PG&E system have been greater.  On both systems=\\n,=20\\nshippers have not\\nhad a system of firm capacity rights, allocated by non-discriminatory, open=\\n=20\\naccess procedures, to\\ngovern who had access to what receipt point.  On the PG&E system, the attem=\\npt=20\\nto discriminate\\nagainst PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PG&E\\'s Line 400 resulted i=\\nn=20\\nthe \"crossover\"\\nproblems at Malin.  Similarly, SoCalGas\\' \"windowing\" procedures have not=20\\nprovided firm, non-\\ndiscriminatory access at SoCalGas\\' receipt points.  \"Windowing\" has=20\\nrestricted the access of\\ncompetitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge, just as t=\\nhe=20\\n\"crossover ban\"\\nlimited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PG&E\\'s Line 400.\\n\\n     Furthermore, SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of \"conflict of=20\\ninterest\" charges as\\nPG&E.  SoCalGas\\' core procurement department has been criticized for=20\\nmonopolizing the Hector\\nRoad receipt point, to the benefit of SoCalGas\\' shareholders through the Ga=\\ns=20\\nCost Incentive\\nMechanism.  See D. 99-07-015, at pages 15 - 18.\\n\\n     However, the Commission should not decide the future structure for=20\\nCalifornia\\'s gas\\nindustry on the basis of whether SoCalGas\\' past problems have resembled=20\\nPG&E\\'s past\\ndifficulties. For electric generators, what is important is that the=20\\nstructures that the Commission\\nadopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be=\\n=20\\nconsistent on a\\nstatewide basis.  The new electric market is a statewide market.  There are=\\n=20\\nalready at least two\\nmerchant electric generators (Dynegy and Duke) and a number of QF projects=\\n=20\\nunder common\\nownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory. =20\\nAnother merchant plant\\ndeveloper (Calpine) has made no secret of its intent to operate plants=20\\nstatewide.  This trend\\npromises to increase competition in the electric market.  To encourage this=\\n=20\\ntrend, the Commission\\nshould focus on carrying through on D. 99-07-015\\'s promise to increase the=\\n=20\\nstatewide consistency\\nof California\\'s natural gas restructuring program.  The unbundling of=20\\nintrastate transmission was a\\nkey element of the PG&E Gas Accord, and should be a foundation of the furth=\\ner=20\\nrestructuring of\\nthe SoCalGas system, as well.\\n\\n     B.   SoCalGas\\' Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PG&E\\'s, and=\\n=20\\nCan\\n          Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PG&E Gas Accord.\\n\\n     Mr. Florio claims that the \"network\" nature of the SoCalGas system=20\\nargues against\\nfollowing the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service=\\n=20\\nfor SoCalGas.\\nYet Mr. Florio concedes that SoCalGas\\' mainline facilities that extend from=\\n=20\\nthe Los Angeles basin\\nto the interstate pipelines on the California / Arizona border do resemble=\\n=20\\ninterstate pipelines.\\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.1.1.3. SoCalGas\\' lines running north from the L.A=\\n.=20\\nBasin to the\\nWheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to=\\n=20\\nPG&E\\'s.  With respect\\nto local transmission, SoCalGas\\' network of local transmission lines inside=\\n=20\\nthe L.A. Basin is\\nsimilar to PG&E\\'s network of local transmission lines in its load centers i=\\nn=20\\nthe Bay Area and\\nCentral Valley.  Indeed, both the PG&E and SoCalGas systems can be consider=\\ned=20\\nto be \"spokes\"\\nof backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt=20\\npoints to \"hubs\" of\\nnetworked local transmission facilities.  The two systems differ in the=20\\nlength and number of the\\n\"spokes\" (SoCalGas\\' are shorter and more numerous), but operationally these=\\n=20\\ncomponents serve\\nthe same function.  In my view, there is just as strong an operational basi=\\ns=20\\nfor unbundling\\nSoCalGas\\' backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there=\\n=20\\nwas for unbundling\\nPG&E\\'s.\\n\\n     C.   The Benefits of the Gas Accord\\'s City-Gate Market Have Been=20\\nSubstantial\\n          for Electric Generators.\\n\\n     Mr. Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu=\\ngh=20\\ncompetition\\namong suppliers in the PG&E city-gate market that the Gas Accord created. =\\n=20\\nFirst, he appears to\\ncite the existing data as showing \"average benefits of around 2 cents or mo=\\nre=20\\nper MMcf/d.\"\\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.2. As cited in my direct testimony, the actual=\\n=20\\nbenefits have been\\nmore than 2 cents per mmcf/d   $0.03 to $0.08 per Dth.  Mr. Weil opines tha=\\nt=20\\nsuch savings are\\nnot significant for core customers.  Ibid., at Section 2.2.2. Regardless of=\\n=20\\nwhether one agrees with\\nhim, such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important=\\n=20\\nfor electric\\ngenerators, whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly $0.35 p=\\ner=20\\nDth, and who, as Ms.\\nYap states, \"sell into a highly competitive PX market.\"  SCGC / TURN, at=20\\nSection 2.4.1. For an\\nelectric generator, a 10 to 20% reduction in gas transportation charges is=\\n=20\\nwell worth pursuing, as\\nshown by SCGC\\'s active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low=\\ner=20\\nSoCalGas\\'\\nEG rates by far smaller amounts.\\n\\n     D.   Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to\\n          Realize These Benefits.\\n\\n     Mr. Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use=20\\ncustomers hold backbone\\ntransmission capacity on the PG&E system shows that unbundling under the Ga=\\ns=20\\nAccord has not\\nbenefitted customers.  He opines that this is due to the high transaction=\\n=20\\ncosts associated with\\nholding capacity.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.3. Ms. Yap also describes at=\\n=20\\nlength how the\\ntransaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to=\\n=20\\nforce end users to buy\\nfrom marketers.  Ibid., Section 2.3.1. She concludes that unbundling has be=\\nen=20\\n\"great for\\nmarketers\" but \"not good for customers.\"  Ibid., at Section 2.3.1.\\n\\n     This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen=\\nt=20\\nof their customers.\\nIf a marketer\\'s services do not add value for the customer, then that=20\\nmarketer will not remain in\\nbusiness for long. Under the Gas Accord, most noncore end users in northern=\\n=20\\nCalifornia have\\nbeen buying gas from marketers in the PG&E city-gate market.  However, the=\\n=20\\navailable data on\\nPG&E city-gate gas prices   discussed above   show that end users have=20\\nrealized significant\\nsavings from these purchases, compared to the option of buying gas at the=\\n=20\\nCalifornia border and\\nmanaging their own transportation to the city-gate.  These city-gate=20\\npurchases have not involved\\npaying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi=\\nng=20\\ncapacity.\\nCompetition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from=20\\nmarketers\\' efficiencies in\\nmanaging transportation costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. SCGC\\'S AND TURN\\'S COST / BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION\\n     UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS.\\n\\n     SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost / benefit analysis of=20\\ntransmission unbundling,\\nlargely through the testimony of Ms. Yap, in an effort to show that the cos=\\nts=20\\noutweigh the\\nbenefits.  Ms. Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling,=20\\ngreatly exaggerates the\\npossible costs, and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o=\\nf=20\\nunbundling on\\ngenerators in the Los Angeles basin.\\n\\n     A.   SCGC / TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission=20\\nUnbundling.\\n\\n          1.   Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the city-gat=\\ne=20\\nmarket.\\n\\n     The experience with transmission unbundling under the PG&E Gas Accord =\\nhas\\ndemonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the=\\n=20\\ncreation of a city-gate\\nmarket.  The city-gate market moves gas-to-gas competition between supplier=\\ns=20\\ncloser to the\\ncustomer, and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying=20\\ndemand charges or\\nmanaging backbone transportation. Those customers who believe they can=20\\nachieve greater profits\\nby managing their own transportation have that option, and since not all=20\\ntransportation rights on\\nthe PG&E system are held by marketers, it is obvious that such customers do=\\n=20\\nexist.\\n\\n     Mr. Weil doubts that the city-gate benefits seen on the PG&E system wi=\\nll=20\\nmaterialize, due\\nto \"Southwest supply dominance\" at SoCalGas receipt points.  SCGC / TURN, a=\\nt=20\\nSection 2.2.2. Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to=\\n=20\\ntrade within a narrow range of a few\\ncents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system.  Ibid.=\\n,=20\\nat Section 2.3.1. The\\nprice differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the=\\n=20\\nsignificant price\\ndifferentials that have existed between Topock, Arizona, and Malin, Oregon,=\\n=20\\nthe two major\\nreceipt points into the PG&E system.  However, recently the Malin / Topock=\\n=20\\nprice difference has\\nbeen due almost entirely to the $0.10 to $0.12 per Dth transportation rate=\\n=20\\ndifferential between\\nPG&E\\'s Redwood and Baja paths.  Over the most recent year for which data is=\\n=20\\navailable, Malin\\nprices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices, when adjusted for=\\n=20\\nthe downstream\\ntransportation rate differences.  This integration of the Malin and Topock=\\n=20\\nmarkets has been the\\nresult of rising Canadian prices relative to U.S. markets, which has produc=\\ned=20\\na competitive\\nequilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern=20\\nCalifornia.  Yet over this\\nyear the benefits of PG&E city-gate purchases has actually increased, even=\\n=20\\nthough there was very\\nlittle difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user=\\n. =20\\nFrom May 1999\\nthrough April 2000, PG&E city-gate prices have been $0.05 per Dth to $0.11=\\n=20\\nper Dth lower than\\nthe comparable cost of border purchases plus PG&E\\'s full backbone=20\\ntransportation rates.  This\\ndata is summarized in my Table 1.  Contrary to the SCGC / TURN testimony,=\\n=20\\nthis recent\\nexperience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new=20\\nSoCalGas city-gate may be\\njust as large as those actually observed on the PG&E system.\\n\\nTable 1\\n\\nNatural Gas Market (May-99 through Apr-00)   $/MMBtu\\n\\nGas Prices\\n                             Malin\\n                             Topock\\n                         PG&E City-gate\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Border:\\n                              2.44\\n                              2.56\\n\\n\\n\\nCity-gate Market:\\n\\n\\n                              2.71\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPG&E Transportation:\\n                            Redwood\\n                              Baja\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                          Firm:\\n                                                           0.32\\n                                                           0.22\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  As-Available:\\n                                                           0.38\\n                                                           0.26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice of Border\\nPurchases at City-gate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirm:\\n2.76\\n2.78\\n\\n\\n\\nAs-Available:\\n2.82\\n2.82\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits of City-gate overBorder Purchases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirm:\\n0.05\\n0.07\\n\\n\\n\\nAs-Available:\\n0.11\\n0.11\\n\\n\\nData Source: Natural Gas Intelligence\\n              2.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG=20\\ncustomers.\\n\\n          Transmission unbundling, as proposed in the Comprehensive=20\\nSettlement, will result in a\\nmodest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators.  My direc=\\nt=20\\ntestimony discussed\\nhow transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce =\\nEG=20\\nrates by $3\\nmillion per year in 2002, or about $0.01 per Dth, compared to the SoCalGas=\\n=20\\nrates adopted in the\\nrecent BCAP decision, D. 00-04-060.  In addition, the Comprehensive=20\\nSettlement unbundles\\ntransmission rates on an embedded cost basis, removing roughly half of the =\\nEG=20\\nrate from\\nSoCalGas\\' complex, contentious long-run marginal cost rate design.  This wi=\\nll=20\\nenhance the\\ncertainty and stability of SoCalGas\\' EG rate   a particularly important=20\\nfactor to EG customers\\nthat may seek to build new gas-fired capacity on the SoCalGas system.\\n\\n              3.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG=20\\ncustomers.\\n\\n          Ms. Yap comments at length on how \"if a generator\\'s fundamental=\\n=20\\nrisk increases, investors\\ndemand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that=20\\nincreased level of risk.\"\\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.3.  In my view, the Comprehensive Settlement=20\\nreduces a number\\nof important risks for electric generators, compared to the SCGC / TURN PIS=\\nA,=20\\nas follows:\\n\\n=0F0         SoCalGas shareholders will assume 100% risk for the recovery o=\\nf=20\\nunbundled backbone\\n          transmission costs.  This protects electric generation customers=\\n=20\\nfrom bearing higher\\n          backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates =\\nor=20\\nif declining\\n          throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues.\\n\\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a=\\nn=20\\nembedded cost basis\\n          through August, 2006.  This removes the calculation and allocatio=\\nn=20\\nof marginal transmission\\n          costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case.\\n\\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined 79% load factor to=\\n=20\\nprice backbone\\n          transmission service through the term of the settlement.  This=20\\nremoves the risk that declining\\n          throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi=\\non=20\\nrates in the next\\n          SoCalGas BCAP case.\\n\\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers\\' risk for reven=\\nues=20\\nfrom unbundled\\n          storage services to 25% in the second year (beginning in April,=\\n=20\\n2002), while the SCGC /\\n          TURN PISA maintains the 50% risk adopted in D. 00-04-060 through=\\n=20\\n2002.\\n\\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas\\' transmission,=\\n=20\\nstorage, and balancing\\n          services.  This will offer electric generators a number of new=20\\nopportunities to reduce their\\n          costs, including (1) city-gate gas purchases, (2) self-balancing =\\nor=20\\ncompetitive balancing\\n          services, and (3) new, competitive storage services.  In my=20\\nopinion, these opportunities\\n          reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be=\\n=20\\ncaught in a \"price squeeze\"\\n          between their gas costs and their electric revenues, because they=\\n=20\\nwill have more ways in\\n          which to reduce their gas costs.\\n\\n          B.  SCGC / TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges.\\n\\n          The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea=\\nrs=20\\nto be the focal point\\nof SCGC / TURN\\'s opposition to transmission unbundling.  Throughout their=\\n=20\\ntestimony, SCGC /\\nTURN overstate the impact of demand charges:\\n\\n=0F0         Ms. Yap\\'s Figure 1, showing the impact of a customer\\'s load fa=\\nctor=20\\non its average\\n          transportation rate, assumes that the customer\\'s entire rate is=\\n=20\\ncollected in a demand charge.\\n          SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.1. She fails to note that the demand=\\n=20\\ncharge for firm backbone\\n          transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou=\\nt=20\\n22% of the total EG\\n          rate under the SFV rate option, and just 12% of the rate under th=\\ne=20\\nalternative backbone rate\\n          with a 50% demand component.\\n\\n=0F0         Ms. Yap presents the results of \"a study of more than half of =\\nthe=20\\ngenerators in the Los\\n          Angeles basin\" that purports to show that \"SFV-style\" demand=20\\ncharges could increase\\n          annual fixed costs by \"as much as 20 percent.\"  SCGC / TURN, at=\\n=20\\nSection 2.4.2. I have\\n          examined the workpapers for this study, obtained in by Southern=\\n=20\\nCalifornia Edison in\\n          discovery, and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for=\\n=20\\nhow generators will buy gas\\n          under the Comprehensive Settlement.  First, the study assumes tha=\\nt=20\\neach generator will\\n          contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement=\\n=20\\nfor a quantity of firm\\n          backbone capacity based on the generator\\'s theoretical maximum ga=\\ns=20\\nuse in a day (that\\n          is, its generating capacity in MW, times its average heat rate,=\\n=20\\ntimes 24 hours).  Apparently,\\n          this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has=20\\nactually ever used that much gas\\n          in a single day.  The plants studied are mostly intermediate-load=\\n=20\\nor peaking units, and almost\\n          certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for=\\n=20\\nall 24 hours of a day.  As a\\n          result of this assumption, the plants studied are assumed to=20\\ncontract for 1,426 MDth per day\\n          of backbone capacity.  According to the study, these units=20\\nrepresent 43% (i.e. less than one-\\n          half) of the gas-fired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin.  If all=\\n=20\\ngenerators in the basin\\n          contracted for capacity in this way, electric generators alone=20\\nwould demand 3,316 MDth per\\n          day of capacity, or 93% of SoCalGas\\' total receipt point capacity=\\n! =20\\nThere is obviously no\\n          such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the=\\n=20\\nSoCalGas system.  Second,\\n          the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to=20\\nbroker, release, or sell the\\n          massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will=\\n=20\\nderive no revenues from\\n          such off-peak capacity sales.\\n\\n          Thus, the study\\'s dire picture of the impact of demand charges on=\\n=20\\nlow-load factor\\n     generators assumes that such generators massively over-contract for=20\\ncapacity, and fail to\\n     take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive=\\n=20\\nSettlement to\\n     reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks:\\n\\n          The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit=\\nh=20\\na 50% demand\\n          charge that almost halves the demand charge risk, but offers the=\\n=20\\nsame firm priority as the\\n          SFV demand charge.\\n\\n          Under the comprehensive settlement, interruptible service at=20\\nvolumetric rates is always\\n          available at no more than a 20% premium over firm backbone rates,=\\n=20\\nand may even be\\n          available at less than the firm backbone rates, particularly duri=\\nng=20\\nlow-demand periods.\\n          With a backbone rate of $0.0719 per Dth, this premium is no more=\\n=20\\nthan $0.0144 per Dth.\\n          Ms. Yap observes (in Section 2.3.1) that the interstate pipelines=\\n=20\\nsupplying SoCalGas have\\n          at least 1,000 MMcf/d (or 30%) more capacity than SoCalGas\\'=20\\nintrastate system.  She\\n          does not recognize that SoCalGas\\' backbone system also has more=\\n=20\\nthan 900 MMcf/d of\\n          excess capacity, plus substantial excess storage capacity.  Due t=\\no=20\\nthis excess intrastate\\n          capacity, it is difficult to imagine a scenario, for the=20\\nforeseeable future, in which a low-\\n          load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu=\\nm=20\\ninterruptible rate\\n          for \"virtually firm\" backbone service.\\n\\n          I have re-calculated the results of the SCGC / TURN study, under=\\n=20\\nthe assumption that\\n          generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service, i=\\nn=20\\norder to avoid demand\\n          charges, at the full $0.0144 per Dth premium for interruptible=20\\nservice.  In this case, the\\n          generators\\' annual fixed costs increase by just six-tenths of one=\\n=20\\npercent (0.6%).  In\\n          reality, I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil=\\nl=20\\nbe available for much of the\\n          year at all-volumetric rates that are much less than the maximum=\\n=20\\ninterruptible rate.\\n\\n          The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for=\\n=20\\nthe trading of\\n          backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system.  This will provide a=20\\nmeans for electric\\n          generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity,=\\n=20\\nand may be a source of firm\\n          capacity at volumetric rates.  Again, the SCGC / TURN study of th=\\ne=20\\nimpact of demand\\n          charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market.\\n\\n          Ms. Yap fails to recognize that low-load factor generators will b=\\ne=20\\nable to avoid paying\\n          demand charges (and save money on intrastate transportation, as=\\n=20\\nwell) by buying gas in\\n          the city-gate market.  Ms. Yap\\'s primary concern with the city-ga=\\nte=20\\nmarket appears to\\n          be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant=\\n=20\\npremium for city-gate sales\\n          during periods of capacity constraints.  SCGC / TURN, at Section=\\n=20\\n2.3.1. Ms. Yap\\'s\\n          testimony fails to explain her assertion that the city-gate marke=\\nt=20\\ncould become a\\n          \"bottleneck\" on the SoCalGas system.  Upstream of the city-gate=\\n=20\\nmarket, SoCalGas will\\n          have over 900 MMcf/d of excess backbone capacity, plus significan=\\nt=20\\namounts of unused\\n          storage capacity.\\n\\n          Ms. Yap\\'s \"bottlenecks\" and marketer-manipulated high prices have=\\n=20\\nnot materialized in\\n          two years\\' of experience with the PG&E city-gate market, even=20\\nthough PG&E has less\\n          excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than=\\n=20\\nSoCalGas.   PG&E city-\\n          gate prices did experience one brief spike, due to very high dema=\\nnd=20\\nduring the cold snap\\n          just prior to Christmas in 1998, but on average PG&E city-gate=20\\nprices have provided\\n          significant benefits to end users, compared to purchases at the=\\n=20\\nCalifornia border.  In\\n          addition, the data that Mr. Weil cites on the parties holding=20\\ncapacity on the PG&E system\\n          shows that 75 parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone, an=\\nd=20\\ndoes not suggest any\\n          undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PG&E backbone=20\\nsystem.  Ibid., Table 1,\\n          Section 2.2.3.\\n\\n          Furthermore, the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions=\\n=20\\nto ensure that any\\n          one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of=\\n=20\\ncapacity to the SoCalGas\\n          city-gate market.  First, noncore end use customers will have the=\\n=20\\ninitial two open seasons\\n          in which to subscribe to up to 50% of the available backbone=20\\ncapacity, without\\n          competition from marketers.  This should ensure that end users th=\\nat=20\\nare interested in\\n          holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they=\\n=20\\ndesire, and is likely to lead\\n          to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr=\\nom=20\\nthe Gas Accord open\\n          season, in which end users and marketers competed together. =20\\nSecond, the Comprehensive\\n          Settlement limits any one party from holding, at the end of the=\\n=20\\nopen season process, more\\n          than 40% of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas=\\n=20\\nreceipt point.  Third, if\\n          any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity, in an=20\\neffort to drive up prices, that\\n          capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible=\\n=20\\nservice, and SoCalGas will\\n          have a strong incentive to market such capacity, because it is 10=\\n0%=20\\nat risk for the\\n          recovery of backbone transmission costs.\\n\\n     The SCGC / TURN testimony tries to portray low-load factor generators =\\nas=20\\ncaught in a\\n\"price squeeze\" between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost=\\ns=20\\ndue to the\\nimposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission.  SCGC / TURN,=20\\nSection 2.4.3.  The\\ntestimony paints a grim picture of plants closing, and jobs lost, in the Lo=\\ns=20\\nAngeles Basin.\\nHowever, there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not=\\n=20\\nadd up:\\n\\n=0F0    The testimony appears to assume that low-load factor generators pay=\\n the=20\\nSFV demand\\n     charges, and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or=20\\neliminate the impact of\\n     demand charges.\\n\\n=0F0    The testimony does not recognize that there will be a $3 million do=\\nllar=20\\nreduction in rates to\\n     the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement.\\n\\n=0F0    The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re=\\nsult=20\\nof demand charges will\\n     be serious enough to force plants to close.  Even accepting SCGC /=20\\nTURN\\'s inflated figure\\n     of a 20% increase in fixed costs, SCGC / TURN provide no financial dat=\\na=20\\nthat substantiates\\n     their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force =\\na=20\\nsignificant number of\\n     plants to close.\\n\\n=0F0    SCGC / TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the \"price=\\n=20\\nsqueeze\" that they so\\n     fear: buy gas in the SoCalGas city-gate market.  City-gate buyers will=\\n=20\\navoid paying demand\\n     charges, so their fixed operating costs will not increase.  In additio=\\nn,=20\\nthe SoCalGas city-gate\\n     market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to=\\n=20\\nelectric prices in southern\\n     California, because it will be the closest market to the generators\\'=\\n=20\\npoint of consumption and\\n     because almost 60% of noncore loads on the SoCalGas / SDG&E system are=\\n=20\\nelectric\\n     generators.

The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two year=\\ns=20\\nago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains=\\n=20\\ncommitted to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly=\\n=20\\nrespond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.\\n\\nThe Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be=20\\nadjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This=\\n=20\\nmeans that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our=\\n=20\\ncommercial efforts.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we will take the following steps:\\n\\nEBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will=\\n=20\\ninvolve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those=\\n=20\\nunits within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and cos=\\nts=20\\nof the support functions.\\n\\nAll EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:\\n\\nEurope =01) headed by Matthew Scrimshaw\\nAsia =01) headed by Anthony Duenner\\nAmericas =01) headed by Rich DiMichele\\nWe will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group=\\n,=20\\nled by Stewart Seeligson. =20\\nNorth American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul=\\n=20\\nRacicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk managemen=\\nt=20\\nperspective.\\n\\nGlobal Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the=\\n=20\\nChairman.\\n\\nAll EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=\\nst=20\\neffectively meet the future needs of EBS.\\n\\nThe Portland office will be closed by October 1.

However, a rate cap will not necessarily kill our \\nvalue proposition in CA.  From a product standpoint, a rate cap will push us \\nback to a \"discount off of frozen tariff\" product as we will be able to \\nofffer some discount based on the shoulder months (assuming there are any \\nleft) and based on how long the rate cap lasts.  As you are aware, this is \\nthe most successful product we have had in CA.  and customers are comfortable \\nwith it.  If the caps last long enough, we can go past the rate freeze period \\nand offer pretty good discounts.  Additionally, customers will probably want \\nto see this product post rate freeze based on this summer.  Additionally, a \\nrate cap will probably benefit our risk management folks through next summer.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t misinterpret this message.  I believe we need to continue to \\noppose the caps.

Can LME Contracts \\ntherefore be marketed via the EnronOnline website to US customers, bearing in \\nmind that the underlying principal to the LME Contract would (so far as \\nEnronOnline is concerned) be Enron Metals Limited (formerly known as MGL)?  \\nAs an aside, each Counterparty that is given access to the EnronOnline system \\nis required to execute certain \"access\" documentation - for the US, the Enron \\nentity to these documents is EnronOnline LLC, and for Europe, the entity is \\nEnron Power Operations Limited.  In each case, EnronOnline LLC and Enron \\nPower Operations Limited execute these documents on behalf of themselves as \\nwell as their group undertakings.  But note that no cases will EnronOnline \\nLLC or  Enron Power Operations Limited be the Enron contracting entity to any \\ntrade concluded via EnronOnline.\\nis MG London Inc. (the FCM) required to act as agent or as principal under \\nthe LME Contracts with US customers, or can it merely market to US customers \\nand then pass these on to Enron Metals Limited in London for execution, \\nwhether offlline or via EnronOnline?\\n\\nThanks.\\nJustin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  \"Jonathan Melrose\" <Jonathan.Melrose@simmons-simmons.com>              \\n             12/09/2000 13:37\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: <Justin.Boyd@enron.com>\\ncc: \"Ned Swan\" <Ned.Swan@simmons-simmons.com> \\n\\nSubject: Re: Action points for Simmons & Simmons\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks - will look at these and revert.\\n\\nOn a house keeping point, is this work for Enron Metals or a different Enron \\nentity?\\n\\nRgds\\n>>> <Justin.Boyd@enron.com> 12/09/2000 11:39:34 >>>\\nDear Jonathan,\\n\\nFollowing our conference call yesterday, I hope these action points for you\\nmake sense:-\\n\\n   Determine the scope of the 30/10 exemption, assuming it was granted to\\n   MGL in 1988 and confirm the benefit to MGL of changes to CFTC Rules\\n   since then.\\n\\n   Determine the scope of the FCM authorisation granted to MG London Inc.\\n\\n   Provide details of the requirements for the purpose of 30/10 and FCM\\n   authorisation in terms of customer warnings/documentation required to be\\n   given.\\n\\n   Confirm alternative bases for relief under 30/10 and FCM authorisation.\\n\\n   Confirm that MG London Inc.

The measure was promptly referred to the=20\\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, whose Republican leaders saw it as a w=\\nay=20\\nout of a politically sticky mess.=20\\nWith Democrats demanding that federal regulators set wholesale rates based =\\non=20\\ngenerators\\' actual cost of producing power and the Bush administration=20\\nopposing anything that looks like price caps, Ose\\'s idea contained the seed=\\ns=20\\nof compromise.=20\\nOse expanded on what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission already had=\\n=20\\nendorsed in a controversial \"price mitigation\" order for the California=20\\nmarket that took effect last week.=20\\nThat order states that during a power emergency, the wholesale price on the=\\n=20\\nspot market will be pegged to the cost of production at the highest-cost,=\\n=20\\nleast-efficient plant selling into the market at the time.=20\\nOse\\'s bill defuses some of the Democratic criticism of that action by makin=\\ng=20\\nthe order apply at all times and throughout the 13-state Western region.=20\\n\"It is not a cap,\" Ose said. \"It is market driven.

What America\\'s most=\\n=20\\nfamous C student didn\\'t learn in economics class is costing the state dearl=\\ny.=20\\n\"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase=20\\nsupply,\" Bush said in his Los Angeles address, repeating a standard lesson=\\n=20\\nout of introductory economics textbooks. Unfortunately, as 10 energy=20\\neconomists from universities around the nation made clear last week in an=\\n=20\\nopen letter on the state\\'s electricity crisis, Bush must have missed the=20\\nlater chapters.=20\\nThe textbooks\\' admonitions against price controls apply to competitive=20\\nmarkets. When competition breaks down, giving one or a few producers the=20\\nability to control prices, the textbooks are equally firm that regulation i=\\ns=20\\nneeded to keep them from exploiting consumers.=20\\nThat\\'s the situation confronting California -- and federal regulators.=20\\nElectricity markets here long ago ceased to be competitive. Because of a=20\\nflawed market structure and a temporary imbalance between supply and demand=\\n,=20\\ngenerators learned last year that they had market power: By withholding=20\\nsupply at key times and places, they drove up the price of power beyond the=\\n=20\\nlevel that would otherwise prevail in a competitive market.=20\\n\"We cannot expect a market to operate to benefit consumers ... if effective=\\n=20\\ncompetition does not exist,\" the economists said in their letter. \"In this=\\n=20\\ncase, cost-of-service prices are an obvious remedy.\"=20\\nThey noted that several useful proposals have been submitted to the Federal=\\n=20\\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for temporary price restraints on=20\\nwholesale prices. These would last only until new plants now being built co=\\nme=20\\nonline to alleviate the shortage.=20\\nSuch restraints could meet the federal legal requirement that prices be \"ju=\\nst=20\\nand reasonable\" without discouraging construction of new power plants or=20\\ngeneration from existing plants, which is needed to keep the lights on this=\\n=20\\nsummer. In fact, as some economists have pointed out, the right kind of pri=\\nce=20\\ncontrols could actually increase supply by removing any incentive for=20\\ngenerators to withhold electricity to game the market.=20\\nBush\\'s regulatory inaction is producing an unprecedented transfer of wealth=\\n=20\\nfrom California households and businesses to the generating firms, a shift=\\n=20\\nthat endangers the health of the state\\'s economy. Unless FERC or Congress=\\n=20\\nsteps in, that wealth transfer likely will yield a political backlash not=\\n=20\\nonly against electricity deregulation, but also against market-based polici=\\nes=20\\nin general.

Ewing.=20\\nAnd when Bush administration officials sniff that Californians got themselv=\\nes=20\\ninto this energy mess, they seem to be conjuring up the image of=20\\nshort-sighted, tree-hugging Democrats who care more about Alaskan caribou=\\n=20\\nthan about people.=20\\nEven if Davis and Bush shook hands and appeared civil in California last=20\\nTuesday, the previous weeks of discord between the two left an indelible=20\\nimpression on the public, experts said -- one colored by stereotypes that=\\n=20\\neasily strike a chord with voters but that also cloud the complexity of the=\\n=20\\nenergy issue.=20\\nThose stereotypes pit the languid, Birkenstock-wearing Californian against=\\n=20\\nthe respectable Texas corporate man; the gluttonous executive against the=\\n=20\\nrabid environmentalist; John Wayne against out-of-towners in black hats. Ju=\\nst=20\\nas when many in this country maligned Arabs during the 1970s oil embargo,=\\n=20\\nattempts to create victims and villains in the current energy crisis easily=\\n=20\\nappeal to public emotion.=20\\nDavis, a Democrat, recently invoked the image of hand-to-hand combat with a=\\n=20\\nfearsome foreigner: \"We are literally in a war with energy companies, many =\\nof=20\\nwhich reside in Texas,\" Davis said after Bush, a Texan, released his energy=\\n=20\\nplan.=20\\nThe image is straight from an old western.=20\\n\"Gray Davis is playing John Wayne against the guy with the black hat,\" said=\\n=20\\nMark Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the Universi=\\nty=20\\nof California Irvine. \"You sound like a socialist if you demonize middle-ag=\\ned=20\\nwhite guys in suits who own capital.

It has the deepest cultural resonance, becau=\\nse=20\\npeople have been exposed to this imagery on TV stations for years and years=\\n.\"=20\\nHelping to bolster that image, of course, is the fact that both Bush and=20\\nCheney worked in companies involved with oil.=20\\nWhile Bush professes no part in the blame game -- \"He\\'s not interested in=\\n=20\\nfinger-pointing,\" said White House press secretary Ari Fleischer -- Cheney=\\n=20\\nraised the stereotype of the superficial, mollycoddled, air-headed=20\\nCalifornian. On a national news program, he called California\\'s electricity=\\n=20\\nderegulation scheme \"harebrained\" and Davis\\' suggestion that Bush allowed=\\n=20\\nprice-gouging \"goofy.\"=20\\n\"You have a war of two biases,\" said Jack Pitney, a government professor at=\\n=20\\nClaremont McKenna College. \"The bias of Texas as greedy and money-grubbing,=\\n=20\\nand the bias of California as shallow and narcissistic.\"=20\\nNo matter how unrepresentative, these stereotypes are a way for the Davis a=\\nnd=20\\nBush administrations, and the national political parties, to convince voter=\\ns=20\\nwhom to blame for the energy mess. That one of the parties should be a=20\\n\"culprit\" is itself somewhat disingenuous, since the crisis has roots that=\\n=20\\nrun across Republican and Democratic administrations.=20\\nDavis\\' once-stellar public approval ratings have withered, as Californians=\\n=20\\nincreasingly disapprove of how he has handled the crisis. Facing re-=20\\nelection next year and a considered a presidential prospect in 2004, the=20\\ngovernor often reminds Californians that the crisis grew out of a Republica=\\nn=20\\nderegulation scheme, and that he is working around the clock to build new=\\n=20\\npower plants.=20\\nCalifornia Attorney General Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, recently portray=\\ned=20\\npower-company executives as criminals: \"I would love to personally escort=\\n=20\\n(Enron Corp.

That contrasts with a historic high this spring when about=\\n a=20\\nthird of the state\\'s power generation was unavailable due to scheduled or=\\n=20\\nemergency shutdowns.=20\\nThe high number of shuttered plants prompted state officials to suggest pow=\\ner=20\\ngenerators were deliberately withholding electricity to drive up prices, an=\\nd=20\\nGov. Gray Davis ordered inspectors into plants to make sure generators=20\\nweren\\'t cheating.=20\\nGenerators objected, saying they have run their plants so hard since last=\\n=20\\nyear that routine maintenance was overdue, which caused more unplanned=20\\nbreakdowns.=20\\nThe Independent System Operator, which runs the power grid, says equipment=\\n=20\\nbreakdowns typically account for about 2,500 megawatts being off-line on an=\\ny=20\\ngiven day. Forced outages stripped the power grid of 2,673 megawatts=20\\nyesterday.=20\\nThe power grid was short 4,144 megawatts due to planned shutdowns yesterday=\\n,=20\\nbeating the Independent System Operator\\'s projections that 5,800 megawatts=\\n=20\\nwould be unavailable. That was down from 9,800 megawatts off-line for=20\\nscheduled maintenance when the state narrowly avoided rolling blackouts=20\\nThursday.=20\\nThe ISO projects that in a week, about 3,000 megawatts should be down for=\\n=20\\nmaintenance, said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. \"It looks like we\\'re =\\non=20\\ntarget with our goal of getting the planned maintenance down to zero by=20\\nmid-June.\"=20\\nMore generation, however, \"doesn\\'t mean consumers can cut back on their=20\\nconservation, because at the same time more plants come on line, temperatur=\\nes=20\\ncontinue to rise,\" McCorkle said. By summer\\'s peak in August and September,=\\n=20\\nCalifornia can be using more than 45,000 megawatts.=20\\nCalifornians cut their electricity use by 11 percent overall, and by about =\\n10=20\\npercent during peak demand hours last month compared to the same month last=\\n=20\\nyear, the California Energy Commission said Sunday. In addition, the Davis=\\n=20\\nadministration has signed more power contracts, and the price of that power=\\n=20\\nis falling.=20\\n\"All that\\'s good news.

While gas in New York costs about $4 per=20\\nthousand cubic feet, gas delivered to Southern California still costs more=\\n=20\\nthan $11 wholesale.=20\\nThat such numbers demand an explanation was about the only thing President=\\n=20\\nBush and Gov. Gray Davis could agree on when they met in Los Angeles a few=\\n=20\\ndays ago to discuss California\\'s energy crisis. Mr. Bush assigned Patrick H=\\n.=20\\nWood III, a fellow Texan confirmed last month as a member of the Federal=20\\nEnergy Regulatory Commission, to investigate.=20\\nTo many experts, the woes of California\\'s natural gas market are as profoun=\\nd=20\\nas those of its electricity market: the state is short on pipelines, and th=\\ne=20\\nrules of the gas market, critics say, encourage sellers and traders --=20\\nincluding the biggest local gas utility -- to drive prices higher.=20\\nAt peak times, half of California\\'s electricity is generated by gas-fired=\\n=20\\npower plants, a higher proportion than in most parts of the country. And=20\\nbecause 85 percent of the gas consumed in California comes from outside the=\\n=20\\nstate, the shortage of pipelines both into California and within the state=\\n=20\\nhas become a big handicap in fueling those plants. The strain has become=20\\nespecially acute as drought in the Pacific Northwest has curtailed imports =\\nof=20\\nhydropower and gas-fired power plants have worked overtime to meet the=20\\ndemands of a booming state economy.=20\\nVice President Dick Cheney\\'s energy policy report last month proposed=20\\ninitiatives to speed approval and construction of new pipelines, noting tha=\\nt=20\\nNew England and other regions faced capacity squeezes, too. The report says=\\n=20\\nthat the United States needs 38,000 miles of new gas transmission pipelines=\\n,=20\\nalmost a 20 percent increase.=20\\nIn the meantime, some industry executives and public officials take the=20\\nargument one step further than the Bush administration, contending that=20\\ntoday\\'s shortage of capacity has made it possible for energy companies,=20\\nintent on maximizing profits, to manipulate prices.=20\\n\\'\\'It really strains credulity to say this is a functioning market,\\'\\' said=\\n=20\\nRepresentative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who as chairman of the Hous=\\ne=20\\nenergy subcommittee has been leaning on the Federal Energy Regulatory=20\\nCommission to scrutinize the California gas market. \\'\\'Reasonable people cou=\\nld=20\\nconclude people have gamed the system.\\'\\'=20\\nIn one significant case, California utility regulators and Southern=20\\nCalifornia Edison, one of the state\\'s struggling electric utilities, have=\\n=20\\naccused the El Paso Corporation of using its control of a major pipeline in=\\nto=20\\nthe state to inflate prices artificially. El Paso officials deny wrongdoing=\\n=20\\nand accuse California officials of making the company a scapegoat for the=\\n=20\\nstate\\'s failure to build more pipelines. A judge at the federal energy=20\\ncommission is hearing the case in Washington.=20\\nBut fingers are pointing in other directions, too.=20\\nFor example, the Southern California Gas Company, the state\\'s largest gas=\\n=20\\nutility, has reaped huge profits buying and selling gas in the last year --=\\n=20\\nactivity encouraged by state regulations intended to lower gas prices for=\\n=20\\nconsumers. But some gas marketers and electricity generators contend that t=\\nhe=20\\ntrading has contributed to price spikes, by tying up valuable pipeline spac=\\ne=20\\nduring peak times with gas shipments driven by financial deals, not power=\\n=20\\ndemands.=20\\nAt the same time, Edison says that Southern California Gas failed to put=20\\nenough gas into storage last fall for residential and small-business=20\\ncustomers. If so, that would have driven the gas company back into the mark=\\net=20\\nin the winter, when demand from power plant operators was high, helping pus=\\nh=20\\ngas -- and hence electricity -- prices yet higher, Edison complains.=20\\nBetween them, El Paso and Southern California Gas were responsible for $3.7=\\n=20\\nbillion in excess prices for energy in the last year, Edison contends.=20\\nSouthern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy, denies that its trading h=\\nas=20\\nharmed the market. Rather, its executives note that electricity generators=\\n=20\\nand industrial gas consumers -- which under state rules are responsible for=\\n=20\\nmanaging their own gas supplies -- put very little gas into storage last=20\\nyear. By one estimate, large gas consumers in Southern California had only =\\n11=20\\npercent as much gas in storage at the end of November as they did at the sa=\\nme=20\\ntime during the prior two years.=20\\nAnother problem may emerge this summer, according to William L. Massey, a=\\n=20\\nmember of the federal energy commission. Mr. Massey said new commission rul=\\nes=20\\nintended to limit electricity price spikes in California will almost=20\\ncertainly prompt energy-trading companies -- which deal in both gas and=20\\nelectricity -- to manipulate gas prices. That is because the rules allow=20\\nelectricity generators to charge more if gas prices move higher.=20\\nSimilarly, growing attention is being paid to the role played by financial=\\n=20\\ntrading tied to the price of electricity and natural gas. Industry critics=\\n=20\\nquestion whether huge trading volumes in these financial derivatives gives=\\n=20\\nenergy marketing companies the incentive to manipulate prices in tight=20\\nmarkets.=20\\nFederal regulators \\'\\'don\\'t seem to understand that firms are really trying =\\nto=20\\nmake as much money as they can,\\'\\' said Severin Borenstein, director of the=\\n=20\\nUniversity of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the=\\n=20\\nBerkeley campus. \\'\\'That\\'s what they do for a living.\\'\\'=20\\nFixing the problem is simple, Mr. Borenstein said. \\'\\'If you build more=20\\ncapacity,\\'\\' he said, \\'\\'you reduce both the scarcity issue and you reduce th=\\ne=20\\nability of people who currently own capacity to exercise market power.\\'\\'=20\\nRegardless of whether companies are manipulating prices, the California=20\\nnatural gas market is fattening bottom lines. In the El Paso case, testimon=\\ny=20\\nhas shown that pipeline capacity acquired by the company\\'s marketing=20\\naffiliate in March 2000 for $38.5 million produced profits of almost $900=\\n=20\\nmillion over the next 13 months.=20\\nEl Paso said its share of those profits was $184 million, the rest going to=\\n=20\\nother companies with which it entered into hedging transactions intended to=\\n=20\\nlimit El Paso\\'s exposure if gas prices fell. About half of those transactio=\\nns=20\\nwere with the biggest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, according to=20\\npeople present at briefings El Paso officials have given to California=20\\nofficials.=20\\nAn Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said it was possible that Enron took the=\\n=20\\nother side of the trades, but he said that Enron would have resold the=20\\npipeline capacity almost immediately, thus profiting little from the rise o=\\nf=20\\ngas prices in California.=20\\nFederal regulators, concerned that the high gas prices in California may no=\\nt=20\\nbe legitimate, have proposed requiring companies selling gas in the state t=\\no=20\\ndisclose extensive data about their transactions. They are also considering=\\n=20\\nwhether to reimpose price caps on short-term sales of pipeline capacity tha=\\nt=20\\nwere eliminated early last year.=20\\nFurther, regulators are scrutinizing the so-called gray market in which=20\\nenergy marketers bundle gas and transmission capacity and sell it to large=\\n=20\\ncustomers, like electricity generators, for one price. Federal regulators=\\n=20\\nhave oversight responsibility for the interstate portion of gas shipments,=\\n=20\\nbut they have not looked closely at these bundled transactions, Mr. Massey=\\n=20\\nsaid.=20\\n\\'\\'The whole thing has fallen through the cracks,\\'\\' he said.=20\\nNearly all of California\\'s gas comes from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain=\\n=20\\nstates and Canada through a few huge, highly pressurized pipelines. In=20\\nCalifornia, the gas is shunted onto intrastate pipelines that deliver it to=\\n=20\\nconsumers and to underground storage fields for later use.=20\\nThose pipelines are now largely running full, and their capacity is about 3=\\n00=20\\nmillion cubic feet a day less than what interstate pipelines can deliver. T=\\nhe=20\\ndifference is the amount of gas it takes to continuously fuel a 1,300=20\\nmegawatt power plant -- enough to light more than a million homes.=20\\n\\'\\'It\\'s not resources, it\\'s straws -- the straws needed to suck this gas whe=\\nre=20\\nit needs to go,\\'\\' said Thom Kelly, assistant executive director of the=20\\nCalifornia Energy Commission. \\'\\'If the straws are full, that\\'s a problem.\\'\\'=\\n=20\\nOperators of interstate pipelines have proposed new construction that could=\\n=20\\ndouble delivery to the state. Indeed, odd as it seems now, some in the=20\\nindustry worry that California could be \\'\\'overpiped\\'\\' later this decade, ju=\\nst=20\\nas it was in the mid-1990\\'s.=20\\nLikewise, Southern California Gas plans only limited expansion of its=20\\nin-state pipelines, partly because it expects demand to fall as hydroelectr=\\nic=20\\npower supplies return to normal levels and older, less efficient gas-fired=\\n=20\\npower plants are phased out.=20\\nBut the gas company\\'s intentions are regarded with skepticism by others in=\\n=20\\nthe industry. Some executives contend that Southern California Gas has=20\\ndamaged the marketplace through its enthusiastic embrace of a state program=\\n=20\\nthat allows it to split with customers the profits from buying, selling and=\\n=20\\nlending gas.=20\\nA coalition of power generators, including Reliant Energy, the Williams=20\\nCompanies and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has complained=\\n=20\\nto state officials that the program \\'\\'creates perverse incentives\\'\\' for the=\\n=20\\ngas company. The generators say it results in extra demand for pipeline spa=\\nce=20\\nwhen capacity already is at a premium, making prices more volatile.=20\\nThe consequences of the gas company\\'s low storage inventories were evident =\\nin=20\\nearly December, according to John Stout, a senior Reliant executive. He=20\\nrecalled listening in on a conference call as a Southern California Gas=20\\nofficial talked about injecting gas into storage. \\'\\'I was floored,\\'\\' Mr.=20\\nStout said. \\'\\'Prices were sky high, and they were putting more upward=20\\npressure on prices.\\'\\'=20\\nLee M.

Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.\\n\\n\\nWe suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.

Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.\\n\\nAny assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\nMarlo James\",\n",

Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a \"new\" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI).  \\n\\nThere has also been a development which makes it even simpler.  At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD.\\n\\nI have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven\\'t looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs).  \\n\\nAccordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan\\'s email to me).\\n\\nI am attaching a number of documents.  \\n\\n(i)\\tThe first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.\\n\\n(ii) & (iii)\\tThese are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming I still need his approval if you have approved - can you confirm this I wonder).  If you have any questions, please let me know.  \\n\\nBoth documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product.\\n\\nRe the Product Descriptions - in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen (and not in USD), we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition \"the relevant Scheduled Trading Date\" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.  (I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology. \\n\\nI have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs.  I have assumed that when NY law applies to \"foreign\" products, we don\\'t usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure however about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don\\'t put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.\\n\\nI understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know.  Apparently  GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed. noon (HOU time) so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday (i.e. today your time) - provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week, this would be fine.\\n\\nRe Exchange Rate, Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these.  This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international.\\n\\n\\n\\n << File: JPY WTI Swap LD1.doc >>  << File: JPY WTI Fin Swap GTC.doc >>  << File: Product Memo 1.doc >> \\n\\nThanks Frank.\\n\\nJane McBride\\n  \\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tAronowitz, Alan  \\nSent:\\t06 November 2001 01:58\\nTo:\\tSayre, Frank\\nCc:\\tMcBride, Jane; Taylor, Mark E (Legal); Viverito, John; Robison, Michael A.\\nSubject:\\tFW: EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap \\n\\nJane:\\n\\nAs just spoke with Frank and he will help you on this.

(ENE) on Wednesday named Jeffrey K.\\n> Skilling chief executive to replace Kenneth L. Lay, who said he will step\\n> down but continue to serve as chairman of the utility and\\n> telecommunications company.\\n> Skilling, 47 years old, will take on the new role on Feb. 12, the\\n> company\\'s next scheduled board meeting, while remaining president and\\n> chief operating officer.\\n> \"Jeff is a big part of Enron\\'s success and is clearly ready to lead the\\n> company,\" Lay, 58, said in a written statement. Lay became chairman and\\n> chief executive in 1986.\\n> Lay also denied rumors that he was interested in becoming U.S. secretary\\n> of energy or Treasury secretary in George W. Bush\\'s administration, should\\n> the Texas governor become the next president. Enron and Lay were big\\n> contributors to the Bush campaign.\\n> \"I have no plans to go to Washington and no plans to leave Houston or\\n> Enron,\" he said. \"I can say categorically that I won\\'t be taking a job in\\n> a Bush cabinet.\"\\n> \"I am particularly happy that Ken and I will continue running the company\\n> together and that he has put the rumors of his possible departure to\\n> Washington, D.C., to rest,\" Skilling said. \"Ken and I have worked together\\n> since 1990, and we don\\'t want to break up a team that has delivered\\n> superior returns to Enron\\'s shareholders.\"\\n> Skilling is credited as generating substantial profits for Enron and being\\n> the brains behind the company\\'s burgeoning commodities-trading business.\\n> That business was seeking to place the company at the top of markets\\n> ranging from electricity to wood pulp to natural gas.\\n> Enron, which began as a traditional gas-pipeline company 15 years ago, has\\n> transformed itself into the largest trader of gas and electricity in North\\n> America.\\n> Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey & Co.\\'s energy and\\n> chemical consulting operations. He became Enron\\'s president and operating\\n> chief in December 1996. He emerged as the heir apparent to Lay after\\n> Rebecca Mark resigned in August as chief executive of Azurix Corp. (AZX),\\n> Enron\\'s troubled global water company. Deregulation of the water business\\n> and government privatizations of water systems, on which Azurix was\\n> counting, were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit.\\n>\\n>',\n",

Our earnings guidance has not changed.  At the same time, we recognize that our investor confidence has dropped due to issues involving related transactions.  We in no way object to your candid and professional coverage of this.  We do, however, object to a portfolio manager (with positions in the energy sector) who has been put in a journalistic position \"going off\" on our company with no facts.  It is inappropriate, if not libelous.  We were, at least, grateful that the CNBC people on the set stopped his wild conjecturing.\\n\\nWe consider CNBC to be the gold standard for broadcast business journalism.  Today\\'s performance by James Cramer was bottom of the barrel - the worst I\\'ve seen.  Later in the show, James says, \"I\\'m all fired up.\"  We think \"fired\" would be appropriate.\\n\\nThanks for hearing me out on this.\\n\\nMark Palmer\\n\\n\\n\\nVice President, Corporate Communications'},\n",

Great for consultants and\\nindependent generators and inbound FT owners but not perhaps so great for\\nothers.  Lots of entropy in the system indeed!\\n\\nI plan to be in Houston next week from Tuesday through Friday and would like\\nvery much to get 1/2 hour of your time to kick off the demonstration project\\nI proposed just before Christmas if you are ready.  We are ready to provide\\nthe top quality service that will be needed to give you and your gas guys\\nthe concerted demonstration project you wanted.  I would prefer any time\\nFriday 1/26 or Wednesday 1/24 first thing in the morning if you have\\nflexibility.\\n\\nWe were able over the holiday to really make a lot of progress on finalizing\\nall of our fundamental modeling technologies--short and long run gas and\\nshort and long run electricity.  I am really jacked up how our long run\\nmodels are predicting the amount of capacity that can profitably be absorbed\\nin ERCOT and where, the amount of capacity that can profitably be absosrbed\\nin California and the WSCC and where, and where gas price basis is likely to\\ngo.  As you saw, our long run capacity addition technique is quite unique,\\nand I have not yet introduced the long run electric and gas models broadly\\nin the industry.  It is possible and realistic for Enron to get first mover\\nadvantage (or perhaps more) based on the results of the demonstration\\nproject we discussed.  Let\\'s talk about that next week when we meet.\\n\\nIf you could confirm one of the two suggested times via email or phone at\\n650.218.3069 in the next day or two, that would be terrific.  I look forward\\nto seeing you again and to working together.\\n\\nAlso, I would like to get your advice regarding prospective investors in\\nMarketPoint.  I am starting to get serious inquiries from large companies\\nyou know well who want to invest in MarketPoint as an equity paly, but I am\\nvery reluctant to consider such investments by organizations other than\\nabsolute, unequivocal industry leaders such as Enron.  I remember discussing\\nthis briefly with you, but I would like to get your input with the benefit\\nof six more months thought if you would be willing when we meet.\\n\\nThanks, and all the best.\\nDale Nesbitt',\n",

Most of these changes we regard as \\npositive. \\n\\nIn particular:\\nthe stipulation of ancillary services\\' definition to include flexible \\nmechanisms such as load balancing and blending along with the storage \\nservices in gas and the requirement that the main commercial conditions for \\nthose are published has been requested by us during the meetings with the DG \\nTREN officials in early March\\nwe insisted on the obligation for an independent regulator to ensure \\ncost-reflectivity of the transmission tariffs, which is now included in an \\nexpanded list of the regulator\\'s responsibilities\\nour message that legal unbundling for is essential for distribution as well \\nas for transmission has been channeled through a number of position papers \\nwhich we have signed up to through various associations.  \\n\\n\\nAlso, the Regulation on cross-border trade in electricity has been amended in \\na manner which enhances the clarity of drafting (see Annex 3). In particular, \\noccasional references to \\'individual transactions\\' which we thought were very \\nunfortunate in the February draft (given that any transaction-related tariffs \\nwere forbidden) have been eliminated in the final text.  Also, a new Annex to \\nthe Regulation has been added. It basically endorses Florence conclusions on \\ncongestion management and allocation of capacity and is very good stuff \\noverall.\\n\\nEnron Europe\\'s press statement endorsing the Commission\\'s legislative \\ninitiative overall and highlighting key provisions of the adopted proposal \\nwas issued on 21/03/01. \\n\\nI will be presenting this proposal in more detail during our Government \\nAffairs off-site next week and hope we can have a useful discussion as to the \\nimplications this legislation will have on our efforts in individual Member \\nStates.\\n\\nEric, Peter has also suggested that we may come to make a presentation to \\nyour group if you think this would be helpful.\\n\\n\\nAnnex 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex 4'},\n",

John Burton to th=\\ne Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcin=\\ng a lawsuit against FERC.\\n=20\\nJohn Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at a lunch with the =\\nSacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about the Edison MOU, wh=\\nich he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review, th=\\ne Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the Natural Reso=\\nurces Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.  (One columnist =\\ncommented that Burton would \"love it to death,\" meaning it would get so muc=\\nh attention it will be hard for it to advance.)\\n=20\\nThe MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC.  =\\nHe said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate.\\n=20\\nBurton is obviously troubled by the MOU; he said \"some people\" say it doesn=\\n\\'t just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.  He said the followi=\\nng would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable:\\n=20\\nBack debt must be verified;\\nAll creditors must take a 30% \"haircut\";\\nThe transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to wh=\\nat the governor has mentioned;\\n$400 million (or more) must come from Edison\\'s parent to pay back debt.\\n=20\\nWhen asked whether $400 million was enough, he said \"no\" and that he feels =\\nthe parent should pay \"a ton.\"  That led to a discussion of the dedicated r=\\nate component, which he doesn\\'t like. He used the example that if electrici=\\nty costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is $5, if prices drop to $10 =\\npeople will unnecessarily pay higher rates.  A larger infusion of cash from=\\n Edison\\'s parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component.=\\n=20\\n=20\\nBurton called the dedicated rate component a \"big problem\" and said it coul=\\nd be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign.\\n=20\\nHe said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state shoul=\\nd set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more (not=\\ne:  this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio=\\n talk shows and other media).  He later threw out the number $200.  The sta=\\nte is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar, he said, s=\\no this is one way he sees to fight back.  It\\'s tough medicine, but as he pu=\\nt it, \"You\\'ve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy, but two days lat=\\ner you\\'re over it and your stomach\\'s OK.\"\\n=20\\nBurton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how he believe the=\\n situation should be handled:  \"The only way to deal with exploiters is to =\\nterrorize the bastards.\"\\n=20\\nAsked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU, Burton said th=\\ne MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress th=\\nere are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December.\\n=20\\n=20\\nLAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE\\n=20\\nShortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsu=\\nit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth =\\nCircuit.  A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afte=\\nrnoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.  If additional =\\ncopies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.\\n=20\\nThe plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the Senate; Bob He=\\nrtzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City of Oaklan=\\nd.  At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, atty. J=\\noe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty. Clark Kelso, =\\na constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz Figueroa; an=\\nd Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland. =20\\n=20\\nThe suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling within 21 days=\\n.\\n=20\\nBurton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling it=\\ns statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.  Hertzberg ad=\\nded that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit=\\n for Californians\\' relief.\\n=20\\nJoe Cotchett said the suit is \"very basic\" and is based on the Federal Powe=\\nr Act, which he says limits power costs to \"fair and justifiable\" rates.  A=\\n primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a \"health and welfare\" a=\\nnd public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million disabled children =\\nand 12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blacko=\\nuts.  He said it is \"not an economic lawsuit -- it\\'s about senior citizens,=\\n disabled kids and convalescent facilities.\"  Today also happened to be the=\\n legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities (the n=\\nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were apparently =\\nasked to sit at the back of the room for effect.\\n=20\\nCotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were opportunities =\\nto exert market power.  He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility (obvi=\\nously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant off-line and s=\\nubstituting higher rates.  He said, however, that this order had been seale=\\nd.\\n=20\\nHe cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of blackouts this summe=\\nr, which could mean four hours a day.  That could be, he said, \"potentially=\\n the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration.\"  Cotchett noted that=\\n only hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from blackouts, which do=\\nes not protect surgical centers or many health facilities.\\n=20\\nJerry Brown added that \"prices are unjust and people are suffering.\"  Conti=\\nnued high prices could mean \"potential civic disruption,\" and that there wi=\\nll be \"more actions to mobilize\" Western mayors.\\n=20\\nLiz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit.\\n=20\\nBurton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV here as a leg=\\nal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his =\\nPress Club appearance.  He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media e=\\narly on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit. Burton\\'s la=\\nwyer\\'s sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal=\\n team.\\n=20\\nKelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for thr=\\nee years, and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably.  It has =\\nfailed to define \"fair and justifiable\"; that failure, he said, violates th=\\ne Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution.\\n=20\\nKelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon \"fellow Republican=\\ns\" to support the effort.\\n=20\\nJoan Breuner (sp?), Oakland\\'s vice mayor, said only that she believed that =\\nif the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California, the=\\n president and FERC would have acted long ago.\\n=20\\nDuring the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary becau=\\nse \"5 generators supply 90%\" of the electricity in CA and all five have rat=\\ne renewals before FERC.  He also said one of the cases that is relevant is =\\nBush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standard=\\ns (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal Protect=\\nion clause.  He also said six states have expressed interest in the case an=\\nd have requested briefs:  Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota an=\\nd one other he didn\\'t name.  None of these states has yet committed to join=\\ning the suit.',\n",

Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.\\n\\nDiscussion summary:\\nBoth parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).\\nEnron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.\\nVEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).\\nSettlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index\\nCould also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany\\nWill look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary\\nWould like to renegotiate by 12/01/01\\n\\n\\n << File: VEPCO Restructure Proposal 11-13-01.doc >> \\n\\nRahil\"},\n",

       "  'Body': 'BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\\n\\nEnron Global Markets\\nWashington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.\\n\\nThrough this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM\\'s experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron\\'s partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  \\n\\nCompanies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.\\n\\nEGM Crude and Products Fundamentals\\nThe EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new \"Morning Briefing\" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.\\n\\nEES Business Center \\nThe Business Center is ready to receive and track all customer leads and service issues.

Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. \\n\\nFollowing are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:\\n\\nENA\\t443 invoices totaling $4.3 million\\nEBS\\t358 invoices totaling $4.6 million\\nEGM\\t 87 invoices totaling $262,000\\nEIM\\t 33 invoices totaling $123,000 \\n\\nIf you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  \\n\\nWe expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.

This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.\\n\\nCalifornia demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.\\n\\n``I\\'m not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don\\'t think that refunds are due from anybody,\\'\\' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.\\n\\n\\nWELCOME\\nNew Hires\\nEGM  - Gary Denton, Luisa Rivera, Marc Graubach, Tassio Carvalho\\nEIM   - Sally Bailey, Scott Royster, John Gwaltney, Shawn Mejdrich, \\nENA  - Trenton Johnson, Kimberley Jacobson, Purvi Patel, Dale Furrow, John LaBorde, John Morris\\n\\nTransfers (to or within)\\nENA - Monica Brown, Rahul Seksaria, Ofelia Morales, Francis McGuinness, George Phillips, Greg Branan, Jeffrey Bartlett, Mark Dypiangco, Ronald Williams, Russell Woody, William Loving, Cynthia Simon, Deann Hogan, Kathy Bass, LaDonna Finnels-Neal\\nEGM - Michael L.

The following consents must be received before Enron\\'s proposals for a power station can be implemented:\\n\\n- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, \\n- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry\\n- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.\\n\\nThe authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.\\n\\n \"This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,\" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron\\'s Cadeo project team.  \"We\\'re pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.\"\\n\\nGasMarktFax Stirs \"Trouble\" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market\\nFollowing on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  \\n\\nEuropean Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month\\'s release of Enron\\'s GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  \"Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,\" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  \"However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,\" Helge-Jurgen added.\\n\\nEnron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland\\nEnron\\'s Polish team have signed the company\\'s first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.\\n\\nThe 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland\\'s largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.\\n\\nThe deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.\\n\\n\"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,\" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron\\'s director of power trading in Poland.\\n\\n\"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,\" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron\\'s vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.\"\\n\\nEBS Celebrates Neos Deal\\nCongratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London\\'s metro network, which expands Enron\\'s coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.\\n \\nMarcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: \"We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.\"\\n\\nLaunch of Nordic precipitation index\\nIn another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).\\n\\nOn the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  \\n\\nGiven the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.\\n\\n\\nLEGAL STUFF\\nThe information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietary to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries.

Lakewood Ave.\\nChicago, IL 60640\\nlrissover@hotmail.com\\n\\nTo Mr. Ken Lay,\\n\\nI'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\\n\\nIndeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nLaura Rissover\",\n",

That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois\\nCommerce Commission (ICC).\\n\\nIf approved, the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and\\ndistribution costs by about 50% for business customers that leave the\\nutility for competing power suppliers.\\n\\nPerhaps more important, the new rates would clear the way for delivery\\ncharge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicago-area power users in\\nthree years, when a freeze on ComEd\\'s rates expires.\\n\\nTransmission and distribution rates account for 20% to 25% of a typical\\nbusiness customer\\'s total power bill - so, a typical bill could rise as much\\nas 10% with these increases.\\n\\nApart from the bottom-line hit to businesses, ComEd competitors and local\\ngovernment officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent\\ncompetitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from\\noffering savings from the utility\\'s bundled rate.\\n\\nAES NewEnergy Inc., the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more\\nthan 800 customers, says 86% of its customers will see their bills increase\\nif both proposals are approved.\\n\\n\"What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the\\npoint where bundled (utility) service is cheaper, or it\\'s so close that they\\nwouldn\\'t bother choosing an (alternative) provider,\" says Philip O\\'Connor,\\npresident of AES NewEnergy\\'s Chicago office. \"You cannot have competition\\nbeing viable when your base of potential customers is so small.\"\\n\\nArlene Juracek, ComEd vice-president of regulatory and strategic services,\\ncounters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short\\nterm because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a\\ncorresponding decrease in \"transition\" fees paid to the utility when\\ncustomers use another supplier.\\n\\nThe Aug. 31 transmission rate proposal, filed with the Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission (FERC), surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission,\\nwhich asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike.\\n\\nThe latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEd\\'s\\naccount methodology, in which the utility would wipe off its books more than\\n$660 million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask\\nratepayers to shoulder that investment again.\\n\\n\\'Unjust and unreasonable\\'\\n\\nIn its filing with FERC, the ICC said the proposed change \"would result in\\nartificially high transmission rates, and an unjust and unreasonable\\nwindfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the\\ngame,\" says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill.\\n\\nComEd responds that FERC itself - in an order last year pushing utilities to\\ncombine their transmission assets into large, regional networks - said\\nutilities could consider changing the accounting method.\\n\\n\"ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of (parent\\ncompany) Exelon Corp. to receive compensation in accordance with what is\\npermissible by law,\" says Steven T. Naumann, ComEd vice-president in charge\\nof transmission services. \"The commission will determine if this is what\\nthey meant (in their order) or if it is not what they meant.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the city of Chicago, frustrated by ComEd\\'s resistance to sharing\\ndetailed financial data, is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an\\noutside audit of ComEd\\'s books for 2000. The state attorney general\\'s office\\nand the Cook County state\\'s attorney\\'s office are joining the city in the\\npetition, which could be filed as early as Monday, sources say.\\n\\nThe audit, which ComEd opposes, would be aimed at separating ordinary\\nmaintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took\\nin 1999 and 2000 to beef up its distribution system, after acknowledging it\\nhad neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades.\\n\\nThe behind-the-scenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government\\nofficials are taking the regulatory proceedings. While the new rates affect\\nonly those customers in the competitive market, they\\'ll be the benchmark\\nused for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in\\n2005, when the utility\\'s \"bundled\" rates are no longer frozen.\\n\\nSetting the rules\\n\\n\"The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future\\nare getting set now,\" says William Abolt, commissioner of the city\\'s\\nDepartment of Environment. \"Basically, the next 36 months are going to set\\nan awful lot of the fees for the future.\"\\n\\nMr. Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure\\nComEd into opening its books, but says it wouldn\\'t be necessary if the\\ncompany agreed to do so voluntarily.\\n\\nA ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a\\nblanket confidentiality agreement - which intervenors in the case, including\\nthe city, aren\\'t likely to sign.\\n\\nMs. Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs\\nassociated with its $1.5-billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate\\nbase. But she allows that most of those are minimal tree-trimming expenses.\\nLarge amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers, as well as contractor\\nexpenses, are included in the rates.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no free lunch here,\" she says.\\n\\nSays Mr. Abolt: \"Now, it\\'s time to sort that all out. So, let\\'s sort it\\nout.\"\\n\\n\\nDavid I.

Also, let everyone know that I am available to attend their individual staff meetings.\\n\\n\\nThe Business Objects IT staff is currently in the process of upgrading the hardware and software for Business Objects.  The hardware will provide better processing times and more stability.  The software upgrade will provide some bug fixes and enhancements.\\n\\nAs far as the effect to the users, the impact should be minimal.  \\n\\nIf the users accesses Business Objects through InfoSource.ETS.Enron.com, there will be no changes.\\nIf the users accesses BO through ZABO, they will need the new version installed.  This will accomplished through a Corp script that will either push the new software onto the users PC or they will have to select a Start menu item.\\n\\nThe go live date is Dec 1.\\n\\nLori Saffer will be sending reminder e-mails as the deadline approaches.  \\n\\nThank you for all your help,\\nLori Saffer\\n713-853-0641\"},\n",

This was also \\ndiscussed with Jeff Skilling--he is clearly interested in the program, but \\nwill be especially looking to your input, along with that of Vince Kaminski, \\nJeff Shankman and me, in determining Enron\\'s decision to participate.  As I \\nmentioned previously, Vince, Jeff and I think Enron\\'s involcvement with WeBI \\nholds very positive potential. Financially, it involves a contribution of \\n$250,000 for 4 years.\\n\\nPlease see the request for your \"Bio\" and desired inclusion of program \\nmaterials, as well as the contact at Wharton, toward the end of the message \\nbelow.\\n\\nLet me know by eMail or voice mail (3-6117) how University Affairs can \\nfurther these efforts.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n--Christie.\\n\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT on 11/04/2000 \\n10:20 AM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\n\"Baltes, Michael\" <baltes@wharton.upenn.edu> on 11/02/2000 12:29:05 PM\\nTo: \"\\'christie_patrick@enron.com\\'\" <christie_patrick@enron.com>\\ncc: \"Piazze, Thomas\" <piazzet@wharton.upenn.edu>, \"Spigonardo, Joanne\" \\n<spigonaj@wharton.upenn.edu> \\nSubject: Wharton program for business journalists\\n\\n\\nChristie,\\n\\nWe are delighted that Greg Whalley, CEO of Enron Bandwidth Business, has \\nagreed to be our featured dinner speaker at the upcoming Wharton Seminars for \\nBusiness Journalists on Wednesday, December 13, 2000.\\n\\nPer instructions from Tom Piazze, I\\'ve attached some information regarding \\nour Seminars for Business Journalists, now in its 32nd year \\nhttp://www.wharton.upenn.edu/media/journalists/.

Our last 3 speakers were Mark Walsh, \\nchairman of Vertical Net; Jason Olim, CEO of CDNow; and Tom Siebel, CEO of \\nSiebel Systems.\\n\\nAbout 80-90 people are expected to attend this year\\'s event. Cocktails, \\ndinner and Mr. Whalley\\'s presentation will be held on Wednesday, Dec. 13, \\nfrom 6:00 to 9 p.m. in Wharton\\'s Steinberg Conference Center, 38th & Spruce \\nStreets, on the University of Pennsylvania campus.\\n\\nAs Tom may have mentioned, this audience likes to hear about interesting \\nindustry trends, or something companies are doing that is leading edge, and \\nhasn\\'t really hit the mainstream. Past experience has shown that \"canned\" \\ncorporate presentations do not go over so well with this group. However, you \\nare certainly welcome to provide literature to the audience or other \\nmaterials that may be appropriate. I would like to have a conversation with \\nyou about your thoughts on a specific topic as we get closer to the event.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we would like to have Mr. Whalley\\'s bio and any other \\ninformation you\\'d like us to include in the course materials for the \\njournalists. Please try to keep this to about 2-3 pages, given all of the \\nother material they\\'ll have in their binders.\\n\\nYou may contact me or my colleague, Joanne Spigonardo, with any questions. \\nJoanne is handling the logistics for the event, so please direct those types \\nof questions directly to her.

The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice. \\n\\nApparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.\\n\\nI recommend that we file comments which advocate our hedging proposal, including weather products.\"},\n",

       "  'Body': \"I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.  I think that tying \\nrankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, \\nthough, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.  I also feel \\nstrongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure \\nnumber system.  We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the \\norganization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a \\ndisproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has \\nweaknesses that force us to grade tougher.  You don't get that in an absolute \\nsystem with preset expectations.  I think your group in particular has done a \\ngood job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) \\nso we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that \\nemphasis is communicated explicitly.\\n\\nI agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I \\ndon't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be \\nsuperior).  I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with \\nthose we need to counsel more vigorously.  I'm not sure we can get away with \\nit but I am willing to give it a shot.\\n\\nI think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger \\norganizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping \\nof bounds ... quite the contrary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tRichard Shapiro@EES\\n\\t10/31/2000 02:52 PM\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\\n\\t\\t cc: \\n\\t\\t Subject: PRC Stuff\\n\\nCan we discuss?\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron on 10/31/2000 \\n02:52 PM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nPaul Kaufman@ECT\\n10/27/2000 07:04 PM\\nTo: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: PRC Stuff\\n\\nHere's my effort to respond to the PRC discussion we had in Kohler.  \\n\\nThe criteria for evaluating folks is at the end of the presentation ... but I \\ntook the liberty to go a bit further and comprehensively address the PRC \\nprocess.    Hope I didn't overstep my bounds ....\\n\\nI'm around today, as well as Monday (ENA meeting most of the day) and \\nTuesday, but then traveling in Reno, Las Vegas and San Francisco for the \\nremainder of the week.   I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss the reasoning \\nand rationale behind the document.  \\n\\nAs I said on my voice mail, I circulated the document to the attendees at \\nKohler (with the exception of Sue L. and Linda R.).  I've had feedback from a \\nnumber of the attendees, but I can't call it a consensus document.\\n\\nAs always, thanks for the opportunity to make suggestions like this.\",\n",

       "  'Body': \"Stuart,  I reviewed the Bridgeline binders.  I found a side letter agreement that addresses termination of the Transport and Storage Agreement.  Basically the letter provides LD's payable by ENA to Bridgeline for early termination.  Bridgeline get's kept whole for the intitial ten year term of the agreements.  For the transport deal, they get $0.025 for 150,000 MMBtu per day for the remaining ten year period and for the storage deal they receive $0.025 for 100,000 MMBtu per day for the remaining ten year period.  Both are NPV'd at a discount rate of 9%.  The side letter and the transport and storage agreements have no provisions affecting the Partnership upon early termination of those agreements.  I am researching the common carrier order and will get back later today.\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tZisman, Stuart  \\nSent:\\tWednesday, January 02, 2002 4:38 PM\\nTo:\\tMcMichael Jr., Ed; Nemec, Gerald\\nCc:\\tRedmond, Brian\\nSubject:\\tBridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals\\n\\nEd and Gerald,\\n\\nBrian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.\\n\\nGerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.\\n\\nEd, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.  If not, my guess is that you will be interested in hearing more.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nStuart\"},\n",

It is clear that 8% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 9% to 8%.\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tZisman, Stuart  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, June 12, 2001 5:56 PM\\nTo:\\tPresto, Kevin M.\\nSubject:\\tFW: New Albany\\n\\nI think this provides you with the information that you will need to present your case to Lavorato.  Let me know if you need anything else.\\n\\nStuart\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tVos, Theresa  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, June 12, 2001 5:48 PM\\nTo:\\tZisman, Stuart\\nCc:\\tPierce, Jody\\nSubject:\\tRE: New Albany\\n\\nStuart - \\n\\nThe approx $6MM of capital improvements were spent January thru June 2000.  The effect is an additional $1.2MM a year of depreciation for 2001.  I am not sure what Kevin is looking at, but Jenny's 2001 Plan had $17.4MM and we are currently forecasting $17.3MM for 2001.\\n\\nWith regard to the Capital Charge issue.  The interest rate that we were told to use by Delainey was 9% - we have since found out that Lavo is using 8.5% - therefore, in June we will credit the New Albany project with $218K of interest.  Again, Jenny's plan showed $11.8 and the 2001 forecast is $11.8(using 8.5%).  The estimate using 8% is $10.7MM.\\n\\nFinally, there is only $54K remaining in New Albany's major maintenance account.  We stopped booking a per start accrual sometime last year on all of the Peakers since none of the plants except New Albany were using the reserve.  If my memory serves me correctly, Kelley Huntley and Jenny Latham met with Jody, myself and Scott Chambers in OEC to make this decision - and Jenny discussed it with Kevin.  There was nothing planned for major maintenance.\\n\\nPlease feel free to forward this on to Kevin so that he and Lavorato can resolve these issues.  Let me know if you or Kevin need any additional information regarding New Albany.\\n\\ntheresa\\nx58173\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tPierce, Jody  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, June 12, 2001 1:49 PM\\nTo:\\tVos, Theresa\\nSubject:\\tFW: New Albany\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tZisman, Stuart  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, June 12, 2001 8:48 AM\\nTo:\\tPierce, Jody\\nSubject:\\tNew Albany\\n\\nI am not sure if I mentioned the depreciation issue on the voicemail.  The issue is that there was an increase in the capital cost of the plant (due to additional upgrades and CAPEX that was done after Kevin's agreement with Lavo was cut).  This resulted in an increase in the actual depreciation figures.  Kevin feels that his original deal, based upon the cost of the plant at the time, should be honored.\\n\\nStuart\",\n",

Running GE may be, as Jack Welch claims, the \\nbest job in the world, but his\\nsuccessor may find it to be one of the toughest as well -- not because \\nanything is going wrong at GE, but because\\nso much is going right, and has been for so long. \\n\\nMr. Welch\\'s successor will inherit a company that is already stupendously \\nvaluable, that has already shed most of\\nits unwanted pounds, and has already set a string of performance records. How \\ndo you do better than that?\\n\\nThis is more than a rhetorical question for GE\\'s next chairman. Pity, for a \\nmoment, a few other heirs to greatness.\\nDoug Ivester was gone just 25 months after following the legendary Roberto \\nGoizueta at Coca-Cola. Dale Morrison\\nlasted less than four years at Campbell Soup after taking over from \\ncost-cutter extraordinaire David Johnson. British\\nAirway\\'s Bob Ayling got pushed out after he had struggled unsuccessfully to \\nfill the shoes of Colin Marshall. And\\nDurk Jager prematurely stepped down as Procter & Gamble\\'s chairman after \\nfailing to live up to the lofty standards\\nset by earlier P&G leaders. \\n\\nPretenders \\n\\nNone of the pretenders succeeded in building greatness on top of greatness. \\nIn three of these cases, the board\\nbrought back a recently retired CEO or chairman to shore up investor \\nconfidence. Sadly, Goizueta, who died in\\nOctober 1997, could not reprise his earlier success at Coca-Cola. \\n\\nGE\\'s next chairman will have to exceed Mr. Welch\\'s near-mythic \\naccomplishments if GE is to continue to fly high.\\nLike Cisco, Intel, Wal-Mart, Nokia and any other company that is exploring \\nthe outer atmosphere, GE must struggle\\never harder to resist the laws that threaten to flatten the arc of success: \\nthe law of large numbers, the law of\\ndiminishing returns, and the law of averages. \\n\\n-- The law of large numbers: Over the past decade GE\\'s market value has \\nmultiplied eleven-fold -- to more than $560\\nbillion from $50 billion at the end of 1990. Sustaining such a breathtaking \\npace of value growth gets progressively\\nharder as a company gets bigger. As the most valuable company on the planet, \\nGE would need to grow its market\\ncap to nearly $3 trillion over the next five years to match the 42% \\ncompounded annual growth rate it has achieved\\nover the past half-decade. \\n\\nOne way of escaping the law of large numbers is to divide big things into \\nsmall things. One option for GE would be\\nto spin out its low-growth businesses as separate companies. Over the past \\nfive years, profits in two sectors --\\nappliances and plastics -- were essentially flat. Holding these businesses \\nmay generate a positive return on\\ninvested capital, but no investor would keep them inside a growth portfolio. \\nWhy should GE? \\n\\nIf GE\\'s next chairman can\\'t muster the courage to leave the dawdlers behind, \\nperhaps he -- or she -- should spin out\\nthe stars. Of the eight large business segments for which GE reports results, \\ntwo -- GE Capital and NBC -- account\\nfor nearly 50% of GE\\'s five-year profit growth. Sure, GE Capital has \\nbenefited from its parent\\'s dirt-cheap cost of\\ncapital, but from an investor\\'s point of view, these advantages may be more \\nthan offset by the drag of laggardly\\nearnings growth in other GE businesses. Looking beyond capital and \\nbroadcasting, there are probably a dozen\\nother high-growth candidates for spin-outs in GE\\'s other sectors. \\n\\nMr. Welch\\'s successor shouldn\\'t be afraid to disassemble GE. After all, the \\ngoal is not to make GE the \"world\\'s\\nmost valuable company,\" but to make its shareholders the world\\'s most richly \\nrewarded. Shareholders don\\'t care\\nwhether GE\\'s stock appreciates or whether it\\'s the stock of companies that GE \\nhas disgorged. Breaking up is hard\\nto do. But Mr. Welch\\'s successor may find that turning GE into the world\\'s \\nfirst $3 trillion company is even harder. \\n\\n-- The law of diminishing returns: Even the most successful strategies lose \\ntheir potency over time. For most of Mr.\\nWelch\\'s tenure, GE\\'s strategies of choice have been cost cutting and \\nacquisitions. From its unflinching approach to\\ndownsizing in the mid-1980s, to its more recent dedication to e-business, Mr. \\nWelch\\'s GE has been imaginative\\nand unrelenting in excising waste. At the same time, GE\\'s top line has been \\nbuoyed up by a tidal wave of\\nacquisitions -- more than 300 in the past three years, many outside the U.S. \\n\\nThe payoff to all this cutting and deal making has been steadily accelerating \\nearnings growth. Net earnings grew\\n10.8% in 1996, 12.7% in 1997, 13.3% in 1998 and 15.3% in 1999. Looking \\nforward, power dieting and binge buying\\nmay not be enough to keep GE\\'s earnings escalator rising ever skyward. \\n\\nThere are already signs that GE may be nearing the asymptotic end of the \\nefficiency curve. Between 1981 and\\n1990, GE\\'s revenue per employee increased by 187%. Yet over the last decade, \\nrevenue per employee grew by a\\nmore modest 55%, and has been essentially flat since 1996. And while \\noperating margins in GE\\'s manufacturing\\nbusinesses have been steadily improving, GE\\'s net profit margin, after all \\nadjustments, has remained pretty much\\nunchanged over the past five years. \\n\\nWhat about acquisitions? While industry consolidation still has a way to run, \\nparticularly outside the U.S., it seems\\ninevitable that it will become harder and harder for GE to find under-priced, \\nunder-managed fixer-uppers. After all, at\\nthe current furious pace of corporate coupling, the U.S. would be left with a \\nsingle company by 2010. \\n\\nThat leaves \"e.\" E-commerce will drive new efficiencies into GE\\'s business \\nprocesses, but GE is not alone in\\nstriving to e-enable its businesses. E-commerce is rapidly becoming an \\ninformation technology arms race -- with\\ncompetitors making tit-for-tat investments to reap tit-for-tat efficiency \\ngains. And while efficiency-besotted CEOs are\\ncounting on the Internet to shrink procurement costs, savvy customers will be \\njust as creative in using the Net to\\nbeat down prices. Whether GE\\'s enthusiasm for all things \"e\" produces \\nlong-lasting, peer-beating profit growth\\nremains to be seen. \\n\\nGE\\'s next chairman may want to borrow a lesson or two from Enron, which has \\nbeen voted America\\'s most\\ninnovative company five years running and displaced GE as the \"best managed \\ncompany\" in Fortune magazine\\'s\\nlast \"most admired\" survey. Forty percent of Enron\\'s $63 billion market value \\ncomes from businesses the company\\nwasn\\'t even in three years ago -- all of them are homegrown. \\n\\nForget acquisitions. With GE\\'s powerful brand, global reach and fearsome \\ncapacity for execution, there\\'s no reason\\nGE shouldn\\'t surpass Enron as a business-building champ. It is entirely \\nreasonable to expect that GE could create\\n10 to 20 new businesses over the next few years -- with each adding an \\naverage of $5 billion to GE\\'s market value. \\n\\nSooner or later GE is going to need an entirely new genre of wealth-creating \\nstrategies -- and a much more\\naggressive commitment to internally generated new business development may \\nwell be the most promising\\ncandidate. \\n\\n-- The law of averages: Over the past five years, GE\\'s price/earnings ratio \\nhas tripled, from just over 16 to more than\\n48. The company is currently selling at a 65% premium to the market average \\nP/E. But being a standout performer\\nfor more than a few years at a time is a daunting challenge for any company, \\nlarge or small. It seems that no\\ncompany can forever escape the steady tug of mediocrity. \\n\\nAt the end of 1999, the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 included 326 companies that had \\nbeen in the index for the entire\\ndecade. Fifty-five of these companies, among them GE, managed to deliver top \\nquartile shareholder returns in as\\nmany as four years out of the previous 10. GE\\'s top quartile results came in \\n1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. If GE\\'s\\nnew chairman manages to extend this streak for another four years, GE will \\nset a new world record, for none of the\\n326 S&P veterans achieved top quartile returns in as many as eight years out \\nof 10 during the \\'90s, and only four\\ncompanies -- Oracle, Home Depot, Intel and Cisco -- cleared the bar seven \\nyears out of 10. \\n\\nIf GE can fire up the entrepreneurial spirit in each of its employees, it \\njust might beat the odds. Like most large\\ncompanies, GE seems to be reluctant to encourage employees to start new \\nbusinesses by giving them equity\\nstakes in new ventures. While this isn\\'t the only way to build businesses, \\nit\\'s one that can\\'t be ignored in a world\\nwhere talented employees are often lured away by the promise of a big chunk \\nof equity in a start-up. GE already\\ninvests in start-ups via GE Equity -- to the tune of $1.5 billion in 1999. \\nLast year GE also repurchased $1.9 billion of\\nits own stock. One wonders just what kind of new wealth GE\\'s own employees \\nmight have been able to create if\\nthey had been backed by this kind of capital? \\n\\nTo have any hope of escaping Mr. Welch\\'s shadow, and matching his success, \\nGE\\'s next chairman will have to\\nkeep a simple truth in mind: If you\\'re trying to achieve unprecedented ends, \\nyou\\'re going to need unprecedented\\nmeans. A break-up, a few major spin-outs, a bottom-to-top initiative focused \\non making GE as good at creating bold\\nnew businesses as it is at improving existing businesses, an absolute \\ncommitment to doubling or tripling GE\\'s\\ninternal growth rate -- these are all potential candidates for the next big \\nthing at GE. \\n\\nMaybe, just maybe, GE will continue to fly high with its current success \\nrecipes. One could argue that as long as\\nthere are companies around the world that aren\\'t as well-managed as GE, Mr. \\nWelch\\'s magnificent buy-and-improve\\nengine will have plenty of fuel. Or that GE\\'s Web-smitten executives will \\ndiscover Net advantages no one else has\\nyet dreamed of. \\n\\nAfter 20 years under Mr. Welch, GE is habituated to meeting new challenges. \\nMoreover, GE has a long history of\\norganizational and managerial innovation -- it was among the first to \\ndecentralize along business unit lines, embrace\\ndisciplined strategic planning, delayer its hierarchical organization, and \\ncommit itself to becoming Webified from\\nstem to stern. Like the Internet, GE is diverse, global, flat, meritocratic \\nand non-hierarchical. \\n\\nMaybe all of this will help GE to become one of the first companies to marry \\nthe rule-busting, business-building\\nethos of the \"new economy\" with the \"old economy\" virtues of scale, \\nefficiency and quality. If GE succeeds, there\\nwill be no more talk of new economy and old economy, for GE will have managed \\nto create a perfect synthesis of\\nold and new. And the most perfectly developed specimen of the industrial age \\nwill have become the archetype for\\nthe post-industrial corporation -- a company that uses its size and \\noperational excellence to crush the upstarts, and\\nits industry-transforming innovation to constantly surprise the old farts. \\nThis is a worthy, and necessary, aspiration\\nfor the next leader of America\\'s pre-eminent corporation. \\n\\n\\nMr. Hamel is chairman of Strategos, a consulting company based in Menlo Park, \\nCalif.

Browning\\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n09/18/2000\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nC1\\n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nAmid the storm that has swept the Nasdaq Composite Index this year, the \\nStandard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index\\nlooks like a sea of tranquility. \\n\\nSince Jan. 1, it has gone almost exactly nowhere, starting the year at \\n1469.25 and closing Friday at 1465.81.\\n\\nBut beneath the quiet surface, a furious battle is raging among the S&P\\'s \\ncomponents, with some of last year\\'s\\nlosers becoming this year\\'s winners. \\n\\nSome of the most amazing performers are the natural-gas companies, which are \\nup about 70% as a group so far\\nthis year. \"The natural-gas index looks like an Internet stock from a year \\nago,\" says Richard Bernstein, chief\\nquantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. \\n\\nEl Paso Energy is up 70% so far this year. KeySpan Energy is up almost 60%. \\nOn top of its stock gain, KeySpan\\noffers something some investors aren\\'t familiar with: a 5% dividend. \\n\\nNow the big question is, should investors be plowing their money into the \\nrecent winners, which also include drug\\nstocks, brokerage-firm stocks and bank stocks? Or is their surge a flash in \\nthe pan that will evaporate as investors\\nget over their jitters in the fall? \\n\\nHigher oil prices helped send utility stocks up on Friday, and most other \\nstocks down. The Dow Jones Industrial\\nAverage fell 1.45%, or 160.47 points, to 10927.00, leaving the blue-chip \\nindex down 2.62%, or 293.65 points, for the\\nweek. \\n\\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.01% on the day and 3.6% on the week. \\nThe Dow Jones Utility Average,\\nhowever, rose 1.52%, or 5.94 points, on Friday to a record 397.04, leaving it \\nup 2.78% on the week. \\n\\nThe S&P 500, still the broadest of the major market indexes, dropped 1% on \\nFriday. But it is just 4% off its record\\nof 1527.46, set March 24. In contrast, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index is \\ndown 24% from its March 10 high. \\n\\nWithin the S&P 500, though, there have been some dramatic moves. Utilities \\nare up an astounding 40%, just in the\\ntime since the S&P peaked on March 24, according to Ned Davis Research. \\nFinancials and drug stocks are up\\nabout 16% each -- again, since the S&P hit a record. \\n\\nCommunications stocks, on the other hand, have fallen 25% in that period. The \\nS&P 500\\'s big tech stocks are\\ndown more than 19%. \\n\\nSome analysts think the move that is under way is broader than a sector \\nrotation. Some of the least-wanted stocks\\nof 1999 have become desirable this year. As huge stocks, such as Qualcomm and \\nYahoo!, have sagged, smaller,\\nonce-neglected S&P companies, such as Reebok and Allied Waste, have soared. \\n\\nThe switch can be seen in an index called the Value Line Arithmetic Index. \\nThat index tracks about 1,700\\ncompanies and doesn\\'t give any extra weight to the ones with a larger market \\nvalue. It is a closer reflection of the\\naverage company, rather than the biggest companies. \\n\\nSo far this year, it is up 13%, eclipsing the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is \\nweighted according to its members\\' market\\nvalue, which means that it is dominated by the larger stocks. The Value Line \\nindex\\'s strength compared with the\\nS&P 500 is a clear indication that some of the smaller stocks are making a \\ncomeback, at least for now. \\n\\nSome of the gains do seem to reflect special circumstances. Utilities have \\nbeen helped by an explosion in\\nnatural-gas prices and by a search for stable investments in a turbulent \\nstock market. Many banks and brokerage\\nfirms have benefited from takeover speculation: Merrill Lynch is up 66% so \\nfar this year; Lehman Brothers is up\\n69%. \\n\\nIf takeover expectations fade, the brokerage stocks risk a slide. And energy \\ncompanies depend on oil and gas\\nprices, which can make them volatile. Natural-gas bulls note, however, that \\nnatural-gas prices are expected to\\nremain high for some time, which could keep propelling that group ahead. \\n\\n\"Very few people thought energy prices would remain this high for as long as \\nthey have,\" notes Donaldson, Lufkin &\\nJenrette investment strategist Thomas Galvin. \"So you still have people \\nunderweighted both areas, energy and\\nutilities.\" \\n\\nThat means that there still are plenty of skeptics out there. If gas prices \\nstay high, the stocks have room to rise as\\nskeptics are won over. \\n\\nBut the real trick during the coming months may not be to be in the right \\nsector, but to be in the right stock, both\\nmen say. \\n\\nAt a time when the economy is slowing and earnings growth will be more \\ndifficult, \"you probably want higher-quality\\nstocks, because they have more stable earnings,\" Mr. Bernstein says. \\n\\nWhen tech stocks or utility stocks are in favor, it is enough to buy a stock \\nfrom the group and your stock will go up.\\nNow investors need to be more selective. \\n\\n\"El Paso and Duke Energy are extremely well managed,\" says Mr. Galvin, \"as is \\nEnron. But the rising tide in\\nutilities has lifted all boats, and not all utilities are well enough managed \\nto take advantage of all opportunities.\" \\n\\nThe key is choosing the stocks that will withstand the more difficult times \\nto come, and that won\\'t be easy. People\\nwho bought Intel or Oracle at the start of this year probably feel as if it \\nwasn\\'t that bad a year for tech. Both, despite\\na recent sag, still are up almost 40% this year. Those who chose Microsoft or \\nDell, however, took a bath: Microsoft\\nis down 45% since the year began, and Dell is down almost 30%. \\n\\nMr. Galvin thinks tech stocks will stage a fourth-quarter rally, as investors \\nlook for companies that can continue to\\nbuild profits in a slowing economy. He points out that analysts expect tech \\nto post 38% earnings growth next year,\\nonly a bit less than this year\\'s 41%. But benefiting from any rally would \\nrequire picking the stocks that will have the\\ngood earnings. \\n\\nAnother way of looking at the uncertain future, says Bob Bissell, president \\nof Wells Capital Management, is that\\nthere could be some unexpected events. Companies whose stock prices have \\nfallen could be acquired, or forced to\\nrestructure, which could provide a payoff for investors. \\n\\n\"I am thinking of companies like AT&T,\" he says. \"Something has got to give \\nthere. The stock is down to the low\\n30s,\" 47% down from its 52-week high of 61. \"Something has got to happen. Do \\nyou fragment the company?\" \\n\\nHe also points to midcap stocks, another of the year\\'s strongest performers. \\n\"I call the category `the forgotten\\nprince,\\' \" he says. The S&P Midcap 400 index is doing even better than the \\nValue Line index, up 22% since the\\nyear began. \\n\\nSome midcap companies deserve to be forgotten, of course. But the index also \\ncontains some smaller banks that\\ncould be takeover targets, and it has some fast-growing tech companies too. \\n\"It is getting stronger as the\\ntechnological revolution moves companies rapidly from smallcap to midcap,\" \\nMr. Bissell says. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nFriday\\'s Market Activity \\n\\nSoaring energy prices knocked market averages sharply lower. \\n\\nAmerican Express lost $1.50 to $59.31, Chase Manhattan dropped 1.66 to 49, \\nand General Electric, which has an\\nexposure to the group through its financial-services operations, gave up 2.13 \\nto 56.69. \\n\\nThe group also suffered from a cooling in takeover speculation. Lehman \\nBrothers, for example, fell 8 to 142.50,\\nGoldman Sachs lost 4.25 to 124.75 and Bear Stearns gave up 4.75 to 65. \\n\\nHigher oil prices helped Exxon Mobil rise 3.60 to 88.88. It reached a 52-week \\nhigh, its first since Dec. 9, while\\nAmerada Hess climbed 4.56 to 73.25, and touched a 52-week high of its own. \\n\\nDatabase software company Oracle (Nasdaq) fell 6.63 to 78.31, with 60 million \\nshares changing hands. Despite\\nOracle\\'s announcement of strong quarterly earnings Thursday after the end of \\nnormal trading, some analysts said\\nthey were disappointed with the company\\'s revenue growth. \\n\\nSiebel Systems (Nasdaq), an Oracle competitor, added 4.19 to 99. However, i2 \\nTechnologies fell 3.69 to 172.19,\\nwhile Ariba lost 5.13 to 152.44, both on Nasdaq. \\n\\nRed Hat (Nasdaq) lost 4.06 to 21.19. The Research Triangle Park, N.C., \\ndeveloper of open-source software products\\nposted a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss, but left some analysts \\ndisappointed. \\n\\nAvon Products eased 50 cents to 41.19. The New York beauty-products marketing \\nconcern said late Thursday the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating a $10 million charge the \\ncompany took in 1999 related to the\\nwrite-off of computer software. \\n\\nAdobe Systems (Nasdaq) moved up 7.25 to 132.63. The San Jose, Calif., \\nsoftware developer reported fiscal\\nthird-quarter earnings that topped forecasts. \\n\\nMaytag fell 2.19 to 33.63, after the Newton, Iowa, home-appliance maker \\nwarned about second-half earnings. \\n\\nIvax rose 2.38 to 43.63. The Miami pharmaceutical maker received final \\napproved from the Food and Drug\\nAdministration for its generic equivalent of Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s cancer \\ndrug Taxol. \\n\\nCarnival Corp. gained 1.75 to 22.88, while rival Royal Caribbean Cruises \\nadvanced 1.75 to 24.50. The stocks rose\\non hopes that the withdrawal from the market of a smaller competitor will \\nease excess capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

FORTUNE\\'s third annual list of Global Most Admired Companies \\nconsists of 379 companies in 27\\nindustries, with 25 selected as \"all-stars\" for exemplifying leadership on a \\nglobal scale. Cisco Systems came in at\\nNo. 2 on the all-star ranking (up from No. 8 in 1999); other repeat \\nperformers in the top ten include Microsoft, whose\\nbattles with government regulators on one flank and perceptions of a \\nfoundering Internet strategy on the other\\ncaused it to slip to No. 3 from No. 2; Intel (No.4); and Wal-Mart Stores, \\nwhich moved up to No. 5 from No. 7. The\\ncomplete list of FORTUNE\\'s Global Most Admired Companies appears in the \\nOctober 2 issue of FORTUNE and is\\navailable at www.fortune.com as of Monday, Sept.18, at 8:30 a.m. \\n\\nAccording to Nicholas Stein\\'s article, \"The World\\'s Most Admired Companies,\" \\nthe schizophrenic market conditions\\nof the past year offer one reason why the Most Admired list looks so \\ndifferent this year. As Stein writes: \"The\\nwinners are companies that demonstrated a new-economy style growth strategy \\nwhile maintaining an old-economy\\napproach to fiscal responsibility.\" And, as Vicki Wright, global managing \\ndirector of the Hay Group consultancy that\\nhelped produce the list with FORTUNE notes: \"There is something new this year \\nin how we perceive companies. It\\nis the emphasis on how much companies are capable of looking forward. In a \\nyear when old-economy companies\\nhave not seen their share price perform, those that have managed to weather \\nboth the old- and new-economy\\nstorms will flourish.\"\\n\\nNotable changes among this year\\'s Global Most Admired list include Home Depot \\nleaping from No. 20 to No. 9,\\nToyota moving up from No. 16 to No. 10, and Citgroup advancing from No. 25 to \\nNo. 18. Strong demand for Sony\\'s\\nflat-screen TVs, digital cameras, and PlayStation game consoles helped the \\ncompany move up from 14 to 6.\\nNewcomers to this year\\'s list -- Enron, Nokia, Charles Schwab, UPS, and \\nGoldman Sachs -- all embody business\\nstrategies that bridge the old and new economic worlds. Companies that lost \\ntheir all-star status -- IBM,\\nHewlett-Packard, AT&T, Procter & Gamble, DaimlerChrysler -- have been plagued \\nwith difficulties integrating new\\nbusiness concepts. \\n\\nMany of the industry categories also experienced significant turnover. Among \\nairline companies, Singapore Airlines,\\nwhich didn\\'t even make last year\\'s list, took the top spot from Southwest. \\nBritish Airways, hobbled by internal\\nconflict and heightened competition, fell from third to seventh. Though Intel \\nheld on to the top ranking in the\\ncomputer hardware and software category, Sun Microsystems rode the dot-com \\nrevolution to second place, up from\\nsixth last year, while Dell, facing a wireless (and PC-less) future, fell \\nfrom fifth to eighth. And in the white-hot\\nnetwork communications and Internet technology sector, all-star newcomer \\nNokia edged Cisco Systems for top\\nbilling. \\n\\nTo find out what unique management qualities set these companies apart from \\ntheir peers, the Hay Group surveyed\\nthe Most Admired Companies and their less admired peers about the performance \\nmeasures they use to chart the\\nprogress of their companies. \\n\\nAccording to their findings, Most Admired companies set more challenging \\ngoals, link the compensation of their\\nexecutives more closely to the completion of those goals, and are generally \\nmore oriented toward long-term\\nperformance. \\n\\nTo complete the list of the world\\'s most admired companies, FORTUNE consulted \\nthe experts: the business\\nexecutives who run companies, and the analysts who study them. Global \\ncompanies were rated according to eight\\ncriteria: quality of management; quality of products or services; \\ninnovativeness; long-term investment value; financial\\nsoundness; ability to attract, develop and retain talent; community \\nresponsibility; and use of corporate assets. To\\nreflect this list\\'s international scope, a ninth category was added: global \\nbusiness acumen. A company\\'s overall\\nranking is the average of the scores of all nine attributes. Companies are \\nranked within their industry, and the top 25\\n-- the All-Stars -- are culled from across all industry groups. \\n\\n\\nThe October 2 issue is available on newsstands beginning September 25.

Lee informed me that HPL would prefer that the volumes are \\nnot brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are \\nno liquids involved.  Lee further informed me that the same day to Tejas at \\nHardy was not in the system, and, per Gary Hanks, needed to be corrected.  \\nLee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10M at Hardy/Tejas and \\n10M at Lomax.  I went into Sitara and updated the deal ticket, pathed and \\nnominated over to Pops.\\n\\nSaturday 1/20/01 - 8:30 am  Sean paged regarding the nomination at Dow \\nFreeport, he was questioning the validity, as we do not often flow at this \\nmeter.  I checked and the nomination was good for Saturday's gas day.  Sean \\ninformed me that the Valero Refinery was up and down and would be going \\ncompletely down on Sunday.\\n\\n10:00 am  - Sean called regarding Tejas LaPorte, meter 665.  Apparently, the \\nmeter had a confirmed volume of 20M and HPL/ENA had no deal at the meter.  \\nChecked in POPS and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20M on a deal \\nvolume of zero.  Informed Sean that the Tejas volume was confirmed.  Also, \\nper Sean Koch George West (meter 6722) had a nomination increase of 10M, \\nwhich he wanted to confirm.\\n\\nSunday 1/21/01  10:00 am  Sean paged regarding the Dow meter 1442, Pops still \\nshowed a confirmed voume of 10M which Dow and Oasis showed at zero for \\nSunday.  I  checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at \\nzero and phoned Sean back to confirm.  Checked on MTP Hardy, Sean informed me \\nthat we came in on rate for Saturday and that current meter activity looked \\ngood.\"},\n",

Do you \\nhave a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to \\nrequire them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?\\n\\nWill we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we \\nneed to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the \\nmost significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I \\nunderstand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard \\nfoundations (as opposed to a credit). \\n\\nOn termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason \\nfor termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some \\nmonitoring ability.\\n\\nOn assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using \\nsomething broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations, \\nperhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.\\n\\nDo we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact \\npayment?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKay',\n",

These bullet points \\nsummarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a \\nconversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) \\nregarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of \\nthe lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have \\nadditional comments, please let me know.  \\n\\nWe still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that \\nup to you, but do let me know if I can help. \\n\\n-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a \\nmonitoring system that would automatically \\nalert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC\\'s system.  \\n\\n-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission \\nfor TW to access the \"Members Only\" portion of CDEC\\'s website (which contains \\nload data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a \\nconfidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.\\n\\n-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on \\nthe confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   \"Good faith\" \\nby ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any \\ndifficulty in getting access to CDEC\\'s information.  TW was never contacted \\nin this regard.  \\n\\n-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load \\ntimes, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers \\nwith access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, \\nbut it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have \\naccess immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.\\n\\n-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July \\ncould have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it \\ndid not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information \\nfrom CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should \\ntherefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.\\n\\n-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring \\nsystem to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the \\nwebsite.  An estimated completion date should be provided.\\n\\nI\\'ve left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of \\nthe website; I\\'ll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted \\n\"on a case-by-case basis.\"  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you \\nknow what I\\'m able to learn from them.',\n",

It seems that this \\nreplacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there \\nwould be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to \\nthe TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and \\nthat we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this \\nthey have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units \\nwith the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their \\napproval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be \\nallowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been \\nverified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing \\nin a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about \\n$3-5,000.  \\n\\nA condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be \\ninstalled on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the \\nagency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one \\nunit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other \\nexceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger \\nactions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be \\nin the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the \\ngrandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, \\nwe comply immediately.\\n\\nI am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we \\nshould test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the \\nunit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know \\nif the Team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations.',\n",

Additionally, the policies allow us generous \\npersonal time, family time, sick leave, vacation time, etc.  We are supported \\nand encouraged to put our health and families first. \\n\\nThis culture allow us many freedoms, and it does not dictate a \\n\"clock-watcher\" mentality.  However, we are all paid to give Enron a minimum \\nof a 40 hour work week (or some other agreed upon part-time amount).  This 40 \\nhours does not include your lunch hour.  \\n\\nAs you are all aware, many of our fellow co-workers on the 30th floor are \\nrequired to give much more than 40 hours a week.  Please do not abuse the \\nprivileges we are afforded, and do not tarnish the reputation of our group.\\n\\nThanks for all of your hard work and cooperation. . .\\nCarrie',\n",

I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.\\n\\nSummary\\nEarlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of \\n$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron \\nLouisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.  \\nECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated \\nwith this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to \\ncorporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting \\n$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was \\nwritten off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment \\nis $121,080.16.  \\n\\nEnron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books \\nsince Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada \\nthought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT. \\n\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 09/02/99 03:34 \\nPM ---------------------------\\n   \\n\\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  Vivien Pham                           09/02/99 08:57 AM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melba A Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Mechelle Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary Nelson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vivien \\nPham/HOU/ECT@ECT \\nSubject: Re: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3\\n\\nChris,\\n\\nIn order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August \\nmonth-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared \\nby the end of this week.  \\n\\nPlease advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a \\nmanual wire/check this week.

Tracy is expecting \\nto receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's \\nmeeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.\\n\\nMelba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production \\nmonth adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to \\nEnron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to \\nsome other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) \\ncut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?\\n\\nAlso, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.  \\nGary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.  \\nHer extension is 3-7720.\\n\\nNext question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait \\nuntil we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?

       "  'Body': 'Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG \\nacquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing \\nmember, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal \\nperspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron\\'s \"regulated\" \\nproduct areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX \\nand has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) \\nchoose to become a regulated \"ATOM\" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal \\nperspective, I think we should have a \"whitepaper\" drafted by Sullivan & \\nCromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing \\nsituation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought \\nabout ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, \\nwhether we move all/part of ENA\\'s existing clearing business to MG (and \\nperhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, \\netc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has \\nasked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with \\nJustin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out \\nwho\\'s on first (with MG).\\n\\nAlso, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking \\npoint and I need more help (even with Jason\\'s help on brokerage agreements \\nthe new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple \\nproportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and \\nEnronCredit.com London).

       "  'Body': \"To:\\t\\tGas Control\\nFrom: \\t\\tShelley Corman\\nSubject: \\tFire Drills and Emergency Response\\n\\nPeriodically we review our procedures during fire drills in the building. Historically, I understand that the Gas Controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill. We need to change that practice. We are required by the Fire Marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills. The short time normally required to be away from the console until the all-clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems. \\n\\nWe are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures. We have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes, but we are preparing for events, such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately. Our interim offsite location in these situations is the Enron hanger at Intercontinental Airport. In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice. \\n\\nThanks in advance for your co-operation, and thank you for the great job everyone is doing.\"},\n",

Although economic and \\ncorporate news was sparse following the holiday weekend, early \\npost-Thanksgiving results in the retailing sector, including \\nrecord sales at Wal-Mart Stores (WMT,55,f2&f4), hinted that \\nconsumer spending may be more resilient than previously \\nexpected. Lucent Technologies (LU,7.93,f2) is suffering from \\nanalyst downgrades. Treasuries were higher as bottom-fishers \\nstepped up in the absence of any salient economic data and \\nEuropean markets are mixed late in the day.\\n\\nAs of 11:55 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down \\n0.4%, while the Nasdaq is up 0.7%. The S&P 500 index is down \\n0.1%. Energy-related and communication equipment stocks are \\nleading the decliners, while semiconductor, wireless and auto \\nissues are among the best performers.\\n\\nShares of Wal-Mart were lower even as the discount retailing \\ngiant reported a single-day record for sales of $1.25 billion on \\nFriday after its Holiday Blitz promotion attracted \\nbargain-hunters to its stores. Most of the holiday buying \\nappeared to be narrow in scope, with shoppers favoring the \\ndeep-discount retailers over department stores. According to \\nTeleCheck Services Inc., same store sales in the U.S. rose 2.4% \\non Friday.  In related news, Pier One Imports (PIR,14.41) got a \\nboost after it raised its same-store sales forecast for November \\nto an increase of 6%-8% and increased its 3Q earnings forecast \\nto $0.21-$0.23 per share from the previous $0.19-$0.21 per share \\nguidance.\\n\\nShares of Lucent Technologies were under pressure after the \\ncommunication networking company was downgraded by analysts at \\ntwo major brokerage houses. An ABN AMRO analyst lowered his 2002 \\nearnings forecast to a loss of $0.53 per share from the previous \\n$0.39 per share loss estimate, while an analyst at Morgan \\nStanley cited capital spending cuts and regulatory issues as \\nconcerns.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY\\n\\nBonds are higher across the curve as bargain-hunters stepped in \\nfollowing the recent declines in Treasuries. Earlier, NBER said \\nthat the 10-year U.S. economic expansion officially ended in \\nMarch of this year and a recession has officially ensued. \\nUplifting comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President \\nWilliam Poole that the U.S. is starting to display signs of a \\nrecovery did little to stem the upward momentum in Treasuries, \\ndespite Poole\\'s reference to rising equity prices, a firming \\nhousing market, and stronger retail sales.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWORLD MARKETS\\n\\nEuropean markets are mixed late in the session, shedding earlier \\ngains as U.S. markets meandered in and out of positive \\nterritory. The Bloomberg European 500 index is down 0.07% as of \\n11:55 a.m. EST. Telecom equipment and mining stocks are the \\nbest-performing issues, while energy stocks are pacing the \\ndecliners. Nokia (NOK,25,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.74,f1) shares \\nwere higher after Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for \\nworldwide wireless phone unit sales by 5.4% to 390 million \\nphones in 2001 and by 3.6% to 435 million phones in 2002. In \\nother equity news, Deutsche Lufthansa AG\\'s (DLAKY,14.00) CEO \\nsaid that he sees \"no signs of recovery\" in passenger traffic, \\nthough he does anticipate an eventual pick up in demand. The \\neuro remained in positive territory against the dollar but \\nretreated from earlier highs. Crude oil is trading lower as \\nRussia continues to act defiant toward any meaningful production \\ncut, choosing to wait until Dec. 10 instead to plan production \\nfor 2002.\\n\\nWilliam Johnson, Market Analyst\\n\\n================================================================\\n\\nLOGIN to access your account:\\n\\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your \\nbrowser\\'s address window:\\n\\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNotice: All email sent to or from the Charles Schwab corporate \\nemail system may be retained, monitored and/or reviewed \\nby Schwab personnel.

Both students and staff\\nenjoyed our interaction with Enron.  We hope Enron got as much from the\\nproject as we did.\\n\\nI also had some additional thoughts about EnronOnline.\\n\\n- During the presentation, the students referred to a market\\'s \"critical\\nmass\".  However, we never defined what we meant by that.  We had several\\ndiscussions on this topic.  I think the best way for Enron to think about\\nthis is in terms of the psychology of traders.  Critical mass gives a market\\nliquidity.  Traders seem to think about liquidity in terms of breadth (how\\nmany products are being traded) and depth (the number of bids and offers).\\nOur thoughts were that when a trader pulls up a screen, he (or she) wants to\\nsee bids, offers, and trades occurring.  So a simple (and cheap) metric that\\nEnron could use to determine whether rivals are approaching critical mass is\\nsimply to pull up screens and see if trades are occurring, and how quickly.\\nTraders will generally not use a trading platform that lacks \"action\".\\n\\n- In terms of New Power, I feel it is extremely important that your managers\\ncreate an identity for the company.  Luckily no rival has done this (though\\nGreen Energy is closer than most).  The company that can communicate a\\nsimple and powerful message will create a competitive advantage for itself.\\nI believe you can differentiate yourself in this market (though you are\\nselling a commodity).  Since you are essentially selling service,\\ndifferentiation is always possible.\\n\\nOn a final note, I wanted to ask a favor.  My nephew recently graduate from\\nMichigan State University with a degree in business.  I brought him to\\nWharton to work on the Tiger Projects.  This was because I knew he could add\\nvalue, and because I thought he needed more experience in some strategy\\nareas.  He served as project coordinator and worked on several projects\\n(including Enron).  I was hoping I could get him an interview at Enron since\\nhe expressed interest in your company.  Any help you could offer is\\nappreciated.\\n\\nThanks again for making the experience memorable to the students.\\n\\nKeith',\n",

Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\\n\\nI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\\n\\nCommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\\n\\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\\n\\nHappy New Year\\n\\nLouise\",\n",

The \\navalanche of new generation projects that have been announced (including \\nEnron\\'s Arcos CCGT 1200MW) since 1998 (outset of liberalisation) could cope \\nwith the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation, \\nregasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed.\\n\\nAuthorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that \\nbad, and so it is connection to the electricity grid. However, access to gas \\npipelines still remains  as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these \\nnew gas fired power plants, but mostly, that some of the CCGTs projects (as \\nEnron\\'s) get financed (find attached the memo about the Enron\\'s Arcos power \\nplant). Pipelines are owned are managed by Enagas, which is 100 percent owned \\nby Gas Natural, who controls more than 95% of gas supplies in Spain. \\n\\nMESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)\\n1. Prompt and adequated development of the gas system to make sure new gas \\nfired plants are built.\\n2. For these new CCGTs to get financed, it is necessary that firm and \\ncontinuous access is ensured by Enagas.  \\n\\n\\nFinancial crisis in Spain\\n\\nThe regulator has also said that given the \"vertically integrated structure \\nof the Spanish power utilities, it is impossible that the California\\'s \\nfinancial crisis happen\". This is only partially true because the CTCs buffer \\n(stranded costs payments) have mitigated the financial stress of the \\nutilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs. In reality, what will \\nprevent a financial crisis in Spain will be the Government, by increasing \\ntariffs if things go nasty.\\n\\nHowever, from the Enron perspective, the existence of CTCs is distorting the \\nmarket, both for retailing activities and the development of power projects, \\nsince market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals.\\n\\n\\nMESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)\\n1. Applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts \\nof the Spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as \\npossible. (By 2003, all customers will be eligible).\\n2. It is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated \\n(distribution) and non-regulated activities (generation and supply), \\nfacilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market, \\nand reducing the market share of incumbents.\\n\\n\\nITALY AND CALIFORNIA\\n\\nSimilar messages regarding the development of the gas system in Italy as \\nthose in Spain are equally valid. In addition, please note.\\n\\nMESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)\\n1. Applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more \\nexpedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants.\\n2. It is imperative that the Italian TSO facilitates the localisation of new \\npower plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the \\ntransmission system capacity and expansion plans. The TSO must be there to \\nhelp new developers (actually, the Italian TSO is very aware of this and has \\npublicly declared to wish to go in this direction).\\n3. The Italian Power Pool was due for Jan 2001, but its start has being \\ndelayed, and it is uncertain when it will happen. For new entrants, to have \\nthe Pool live and running is of special interest to a) increase the \\nunderstanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the Italian market and \\nb) to increase liquidity. Also, make sure you mention that the Pool should \\nhelp entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all \\nparticipants, mostly on its inception phase.  \\n\\n\\nPlease, find attached a short summary of the Arcos situation. The main issue \\nhere is that Enagas (gas transco monopoly) is trying to grant access to \\ntransportation and regasfication infrastructures CONDITIONAL to the \\nconstruction of a number of new infrastructures, which are also subject to \\nobtaining permits issued by the authorities. Instead, the regulator (CNE) has \\nbasically imposed Enagas an obligation to build and grant access to Enron on \\na firm and continuous basis, that is, no conditional. The regulator\\'s \\ndecision is binding but not normative.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom:  Shapiro, Richard  \\nSent: martes, 29 de mayo de 2001 16:15\\nTo: Styles, Peter; Huertas, Alfredo\\nSubject: Kean\\'s speech\\n\\nAlso, anything explaining Spanish regulator\\'s decision re: Arcos would be \\nhelpful if you could forward.

       "  'Body': 'On Friday, June 15th, a Draft Decision (by ALJ Barnett) and an Alternate\\nDecision (by Commissioner Bilas) were released addressing the suspension of\\nthe PX credit and the suspension of direct access.  In short, both the Draft\\nand the Alternate granted SCE\\'s Petition to suspend payment of the PX credit\\nas of January 5, 2001.  The Draft Decision continues by invoking Section\\n80110 of the Water Code (enacted under ABX1 1) and suspending new Direct\\nAccess transactions as of July 1, 2001.  The Alternate does not suspend\\ndirect access but requests comments on how the Commission can accommodate\\nthe concerns of DWR with respect to continuation of direct access (besides\\nsuspension) without violating Section 80110.\\n\\nBarnett Draft Decision\\n\\nThe Barnett draft goes through an illustration of the PX credit with the\\nintent of showing that during the rate freeze period \"should a direct access\\ncustomer pay less than the PX energy price to its ESP, the direct access\\ncustomer is being subsidized by the public utility and, perhaps the\\nutility\\'s ratepayers.\"  The decision goes on to say, that \"we note in the\\nstipulation between SCE, Enron and WPTF, there is no mention of a cash\\nrefund to direct access customers -- the reference is to a credit.\" There is\\nno provision in the stipulation which would require SCE to make a cash\\npayment in lieu of a credit.  \"Utility cash which is in short supply, should\\nbe conserved to provide reliable service, not subsidize direct access.\"\\nThe draft decision continues by suspending DA as of July 1, 2001 and\\napplying the order to PG&E as well.\\n\\nBilas Alternate\\n\\nThe Bilas Alternate goes through a similar analysis with respect to the PX\\ncredit payments (without as much verbiage as to the subsidization of DA\\ncustomers).  Bilas also makes it clear that while payment of cash is\\nsuspended, \"SCE must continue to track and accrue credits for DA customers.\"\\n\\nWith respect to the suspension of direct access, the Bilas Alternate holds\\noff.  It appends a letter from DWR to the Commission as to its concerns\\nabout the impact of the continuation of Direct Access on the issuance of the\\nbonds and asks parties to comment thereon. It is letter, DWR has set forth\\nwhat it believes will be required in the way of exit fees by DA customers to\\nallow the issuance of long term bonds with investment grade.\\n\\nIn addition, Bilas is looking for comments on getting away from the PX\\ncredit and going to a bottoms up calculation of DA customer bills.\\n\\nComments\\n\\nComments on Both the Draft and Alternate are due on Monday the 25th.\\n\\nComments on moving to a bottoms up approach are due on July 6th.\\n\\n\\nCopies of the decisions have been faxed to Sue Mara in SF and Jim Steffes in\\nHouston. They are also available on the commission\\'s web site under the\\n\"currently open for comment\" section.  If anyone would like me to fax them a\\ncopy directly, let me know.\\n\\nJeanne Bennett'},\n",

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\\n\\nAcquiring a Company\\n\\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\\nviability\\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\\nA,\\nand so on.\\n\\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for Company T\\'s shares.  This offer must be made now,\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press.\\n\\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\\nanything less than $50.\\n\\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T\\'s\\nstock?\\n\\n     $______ per/share',\n",

       "  'Body': 'Gentlemen:\\n\\n1.  I have spoken with David Best about the difficulty Paul Henking has \\nencountered so far with getting any agreement from Mitsubishi to delay both \\nthe joint survey/testing and arbitration in hopes of a settlement.  As I \\nunderstand Paul\\'s suggestion, Paul wants to switch fronts and press our cargo \\nunderwriters to pay us off and handle the arbitration themselves (Paul, if I \\nhave misstated your strategy, please let me know).  I understand from Paul\\'s \\ne-mail that he does not think Mitsubishi will settle prior to arbitration and \\njoint testing.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while we want to consider all options, neither David nor I \\nthink that this approach will succeed.  We believe that our cargo \\nunderwriter\\'s response to our claim will be that they, too, want us to \\nproceed with the joint testing before they will consider paying anything on \\nthis claim.  We should also all recall that ECT performed a pre-sale survey \\nof product from the same location that was off-spec.  Although we do not \\nthink that either Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are yet aware of that \\nsurvey, such a survey would seem to raise an inherent vice issue in both \\nproceedings.  Last, until at least the joint testing has been done, I think \\nthat the cargo underwriters would require us to act as a prudent uninsured; \\ni.e., to name an arbitrator and vigorously litigate our claims.\\n\\nOf particular note, Steve Jones, our expert chemist, has notified us that the \\nsamples taken for joint testing have a shelf-life that may be coming to an \\nend in the near future.  If the samples begin to \"turn\" before the joint \\ntesting has taken place, the delay of the testing could be used against us in \\nthe arbitration.  Parenthetically, it also appears that a representative of \\nthe shipowner\\'s P&I club wants to be involved in the testing.  It may be that \\nMitsubishi, as the vessel\\'s charterer, has placed the head owner on notice of \\nour claim against Mitsubishi, and of Mitsubishi\\'s potential claim for \\nindemnification against the head owner.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, David and I agree that we should get the joint \\ntesting scheduled and done as soon as possible.\\n\\n2. David and I have also spoken about Paul\\'s idea of advancing payment to \\nMitsubishi for the freight claim of $760,000, and agreeing to revert to \\nMitsubishi regarding the demurrage claim by the end of November.  I assume \\nthat Paul means that we would in fact pay what we believe we owed on the \\n$250,000 demurrage claim at or near that time, and that all these amounts \\nwould be paid on a \"without prejudice\" basis; i.e., that ECT could later \\npursue recovery of those amounts in arbitration against Mitsubishi.\\n\\nThe obvious downside of payment is that we lose our best potential leverage \\nfor bringing Mitsubishi to the bargaining table, but Mitsubishi has resisted \\nthat leverage so far.  We are very exposed to advance payment of freight and \\ndemurrage, subject to our later right of counterclaim if we can successfully \\nassert that the ship was at fault.  By paying now, we can avoid the \\nattorneys\\' fees (and, hopefully, some or all of the interest) that would go \\nwith an interim award to Mitsubishi.  I have not been advised of any \\nanticipated problem with getting Mitsubishi to fund a substantial arbitration \\naward should ECT be successful in proving its contamination claim and \\nrecouping the freight and demurrage paid.  \\n\\nUnder these  difficult circumstances, both David and I agree with Paul\\'s \\nsuggestion that we pay the freight and demurrage up front, without prejudice, \\nbut only after we have informally discussed this on a solictor-to-solicitor \\nbasis, so that there is no misunderstanding of ECT\\'s intent to pursue the \\ncontamination claim, and after a tribunal has been agreed to and any other \\nconcessions extracted that we can think of.  This will prevent Mitsubishi \\nfrom dragging its feet after we make this payment.  \\n\\n3.  David and I have spoken about the choice of arbitrators for this \\nsingle-arbitrator proceeding.  He and Neale agree that using a Q.C. would \\ngive us the best shot at a well-thought-through legal opinion, and here, our \\nbest argument may be simply to argue that Mitsubishi has not borne its legal \\nburden to provide a cargoworthy ship.  Based on David and Neale\\'s suggestion, \\nI have asked David to approach Mitsubishi\\'s solicitors on an informal basis \\nto discuss three Q.Cs that David and Neale find acceptable, and determine \\nwhether Mitsubishi\\'s solicitors also find them acceptable.  Once that occurs, \\nI will revert back to each of you with a recommendation of a single \\narbitrator.  That should hopefully occur today or tomorrow.\\n\\nI will continue to keep you advised.\\n\\nBritt'},\n",

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\\nPhone\\n512-795-8536\\n\\nHorns Have Final Public Scrimmage Before Huge Crowd\\nCoach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a short, but spirited scrimmage\\nWednesday night in Royal Memorial Stadium before an enthusiastic crowd UT\\nofficials estimated at about 7,500.\\nWith the first-team defense sitting out most of the scrimmage, the offenses\\ndominated most of the way. Chris Simms hit 5 of 8 passes for 144 yards,\\nincluding a 5-yard touchdown pass to freshman sensation Roy Williams, who\\nhad\\nset up the score with a great catch of a  50-yard Simms\\' throw, and a\\n67-yard\\nTD pass to WR Montrell Flowers off a fake reverse.\\nThe first-team offense also scored on a two-yard run by TB Victor Ike,\\nafter\\nstarting TB Hodges Mitchell set it up with a 50-yard gallop.\\nBut QB Major Applewhite led the second-team offense to two touchdowns,\\nhitting 10 of 13 for 173 yards, including scoring tosses of 70 yards to the\\nother sensational freshman WR, B. J. Johnson, and 15 yards to senior\\nBrandon\\nHealy. Applewhite\\'s TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and\\nJohnson just ran away from all the pursuit. Starting safety Greg Brown\\nintercepted one of Applewhite\\'s throws on the second-team\\'s first\\npossession.\\nBrown still wouldn\\'t give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the\\nseason opener next week, but did say both QBs played well. Brown also said,\\n\"I was really pleased with the wide receivers. I thought they made some\\nsteps\\nin running better routes and making the tough catches.\"\\nHe also said Ike is clearly the No. 2 TB behind Mitchell at this point.\\nRedshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring, but has not been\\ndominating during the current practices. He also has had some nagging\\ninjuries. Brown said Ike, the fastest of the tailbacks, has been doing well\\nin practice. \"Victor has been doing the best since he\\'s been here,\" Brown\\nsaid. \"He is doing much better without the ball (blocking) than he has in\\nthe\\npast.\"\\n* * * *\\nDefensive coordinator Carl Reese, who has nine starters back, says he is\\nfeeling better about his new defensive ends. \"I\\'ve got four guys I think\\ncan\\nplay,\" Reese said. \"Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters, and\\nKaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job. He just keeps getting\\nbetter, so he\\'ll be the first backup for Anderson, and Cole Pittman has had\\nthree solid scrimmages in a row, so  he\\'ll be the guy behind Redding. I\\nthink\\nall four of them will play a lot, and they\\'re the four main ones right\\nnow.\"\\nThornton, a true freshman, is one of the larger DEs at about 6-3, 270, but\\nReese  said he is \"pretty quick out there. He gets a good rush from the\\nedge,\\nand that\\'s what we like. He also is learning to do a better job against the\\nrun.\"\\nHe said Pittman, who was moved over from tackle to provide better run\\nsupport, \"has been doing a good job against the run, and he\\'s a pretty good\\npass rusher, too. I think we\\'ll be okay with those four guys as soon as\\nthey\\nget a little more experience.\"\\n* * * *\\nBrown said the team will have one more open practice and it will be\\nThursday\\nat 3:30 at Denius Field. Then he plans to give the team three days off to\\ntry\\nto let the players recover from the grueling two-a-day workouts. The team\\nwill go back to work Monday to get ready for the Saturday opener at 11:30\\na.m. against Louisiana-Lafayette.\\n* * * *\\nINJURY UPDATE: Brown said OT Mike Williams suffered a twisted leg in the\\nscrimmage, but he said he didn\\'t think it was serious.\\n* * * *\\nRECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorns still have 13 commitments. DE Eric Hall,\\n6-3, 225, 4.5, of Clarksville, Tenn., who will take his official visit to\\nTexas the Sept, 9 weekend, rushed 10 times for 102 yards and completed 5 of\\n7\\npasses for 106 yards and two TDs to lead his team to a 34-0 victory over\\nSpringfield  Friday in the season opener for both teams. He plays QB and\\nsafety, but said he didn\\'t play any defense after the first half. . . DT\\nTommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, says Texas is still his top team, and he\\nsaid he will come to the Louisiana-Lafayette game Dec. 9. \"I really like\\nwhat\\nMack Brown has been doing since he came to Texas,\" Harris said.\\n* * * *\\nMy next fax will be whenever events warrant.\\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.\\n\\nThe Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we will take the following steps:\\n\\nEBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.\\n\\nAll EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:\\n\\nEurope - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw\\nAsia - headed by Anthony Duenner\\nAmericas - headed by Rich DiMichele\\nWe will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  \\nNorth American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.\\n\\nGlobal Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.\\n\\nAll EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.\\n\\nThe Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.\\n\\nThese changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.',\n",

We have written \\nthis up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- \\nplease take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should \\nidentify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that \\ncould be sent to the FERC.\\nMurkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the \\nfed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is \\nnecessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for \\nopen access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the \\n2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- \\ncould you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get \\nthem to Linda?\\nFinally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to \\n\"price gouge\" -- yes, that\\'s what she said.  She appealed to everyone\\'s \\ncommunity spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while \\nCalifornia struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response \\nfrom Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic \\nmessages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California \\npolicymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively \\npursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the \\nnature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we \\nidentified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.',\n",

The price works out to less than $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent, given the proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. \"We value other Indian oil and gas reserves at $2.90 (assuming an oil price of $18), so BG appears to have paid a good price,\" said ABN Amro in a research note.\\nA Bombay-based energy analyst reckoned Enron \"probably undersold,\" noting that earlier this year Indian state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., a partner of Enron\\'s Indian unit, had its $400 million offer for the assets rejected. \\nEnron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in India, and is attempting to exit the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India\\'s largest private power plant, in which it has a 65% controlling stake. \\nThe Indian unit\\'s assets comprise a 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, and a 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration license in the Gulf of Cambay off western India. The Enron unit is the designated operator of these developments. \\nEquity production from the fields amounts to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, representing about 6% to 7% of BG\\'s total output. For the year ended March 31, Enron\\'s Indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $60 million on revenue of $160 million. \\nThe acquisition complements BG\\'s fledgling refining and marketing interests in India, which include holdings in western Indian distributors Gujarat Gas Co.

It is also the driving force behind a project to pipe liquefied natural gas from Iran to tap India\\'s growing appetite for gas.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Extreme Networks jumped 1.42, or 22%, to 7.84. Foundry Networks climbed 1.04, or 16%, to 7.37. Ciena improved 2.52, or 27%, to 12.03. All trade on the Nasdaq. \\nThe gains came after Cisco\\'s chief executive, John Chambers, told an audience at a broker-sponsored conference that the company felt comfortable with estimates for its earnings in the current quarter, which ends this month. \\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index, sparked by the bulge in technology prices, shot up 88.48, or 5.93%, the index\\'s biggest one-day improvement since the spring, and the fifth-sharpest improvement this year, as well as the 14th-best one-day advance ever. The index finished the session at 1580.81, which is just above where it closed Sept. 10, the day before the terrorists struck the U.S. \\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which got a strong contribution from technology components like Microsoft and International Business Machines, climbed 173.19 points, or 1.93%. That was the ninth-sharpest one-day gain this year; the industrial average ended at 9123.78. \\n\"There was a real nice tone to the market today,\" said Pat Davis, head of Nasdaq trading at UBS Warburg, said. \"But I don\\'t think you can say we\\'ve heard all the bad news we\\'re going to hear. \\nOver the past three weeks, Wall Street analysts had been systematically reducing their earnings projections to better reflect the deterioration in economic conditions. Only over the past several days had they begun to focus on valuations, saying that, in some instances, stock prices looked attractive, even projecting weaker earnings. \\nLehman Brothers, for example, jumped to the defense of some software names, and a number of those marked improvement. Shares of PeopleSoft gained 3.14, or 15%, to 23.68 on the Nasdaq, a 50% improvement over its Sept. 27 52-week low of 15.78. BMC Software added 74 cents, or 5.8%, to 13.60. \\nA number of storage-products makers marked sharp improvements, after Dain Rauscher Wessels insisted high-quality names in the sector would be able to realize earnings targets. McData, for example, rose 2.11, or 26%, to 10.15, while QLogic shot up 5.89, or 33%, to 23.96, both on the Nasdaq. \\nSeveral other sectors of the market, including those that have suffered most in the days since the attacks on Sept. 11, managed to mount recoveries. Shares of Delta Air Lines gained 2.27, or 8.4%, to 29.36. Continental Airlines advanced 1.93, or 11%, to 19.32. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1.45, or 7%, to 22.12. \\nShares of several insurers moved higher on the prospects of higher rates. Ace climbed 5.41, or 19%, to 34.31. Everest Re added 5.24, or 7.6%, to 73.80. XL Capital advanced 5.05, or 6.2%, to 86.45. \\nNortel Networks wasn\\'t punished for warnings that it would report a much wider loss in the third quarter than analysts had been anticipating. Nevertheless, the stock finished 25 cents higher, up 4.7%, at 5.54. \\nL-3 Communications added 4.22, or 4.7%, to 93.60, reaching a 52-week high. The New York maker of defense communications products signed an agreement to acquire the Canadian aviation-services provider Spar Aerospace. \\nSun Microsystems moved up 99 cents, or 12%, to 9 on the Nasdaq. The Palo Alto, Calif., networking-products developer said it received a two-year, $100 million sourcing pact from News Corp. \\nQwest Communications, which slumped to a 52-week low Tuesday, gained 1.60, or 10%, to 17.20. CIBC World Markets talked up the stock, citing its valuation. \\nEli Lilly fell 3.62, or 4.4%, to 79.25. The drug maker warned that sales of its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac have eroded faster than expected after it lost its patent protection two months ago. \\nShares of several independent energy marketers moved higher, helped by comments from Salomon Smith Barney, which said the recent selloff in the group left the stocks at attractive valuations. Enron gained 2.88, or 9.4%, to 33.49, Dynegy added 1.66, or 4.3%, to 39.96, and Duke Energy gained 37 cents, or 0.9%, to 39.60. \\nBest Buy rose 3.70, or 9.2%, to 48.80 in what proved a strong session for retail, after Credit Suisse First Boston called the Minneapolis retailer the best name in hardline consumer-electronics retailing. \\nShares of some real-estate-investment trusts weakened, following skeptical comments on earnings from UBS Warburg. Boston Properties fell 1.48, or 3.9%, to 36.37, Simon Property, Indianapolis, eased 20 cents, or 0.7%, to 26.90, and Apartment Investment and Management, Denver, lost 1.56, or 3.5%, to 42.80. \\nIdec Pharmaceuticals advanced 2.12, or 4.1%, to 53.74, on upbeat comments Dain Rauscher made about the drug developer.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities. \\nIt is \"another significant step for Enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses,\" the company said in a written statement. \\nEnron\\'s other assets for sale in India include the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India\\'s largest private power plant, in which Enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake. \\nReports surfaced Wednesday that Enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $3 billion project at a discount. Analysts have said for months now that Enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer. Tata Power Co., India\\'s largest private electricity firm, has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over Dabhol. \\nThe oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the Tapti natural gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of Mumbai and a 62.6 percent interest in the offshore block CB-OS/1 exploration license. All are on the west coast of India. \\nProduction from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. Reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent. BG paid about $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent. \\nThe other partners in the Tapti and Panna/Mukta offshore operations are Oil and Natural Gas Corp., which holds 40 percent, and Reliance Industries, with a 30 percent stake. The other partners in the CB-OS/1 license are Hindustan Oil Exploration Co., with 17.36 percent, Tata Petrodyne with 10 percent, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. with 10 percent. \\nEnron acquired its natural gas reserves in India with an eye to using them as fuel in the Dabhol plant. \\nIn August, Houston-based Enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in Dabhol for no less than $1 billion, an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project. \\nDabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer. It was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on India\\'s west coast in June after the board stopped buying power. \\nJohn Ambler, Enron spokesman, would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the Dabhol project, but said the company favors selling its stake. \\n\"We continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of India and/or Indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant,\" Ambler said. \"We are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs.\" \\nThe shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2,184 megawatts. \\nOther partners in Dabhol include General Electric and the Bechtel construction firm, which each own 10 percent. \\nThe remaining 15 percent is held by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located. \\nBG\\'s existing interests in India include holdings in western Indian natural gas distributors Gujarat Gas Co. and Mahanagar Gas. The company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from Iran via pipeline into India. \\nIndia\\'s gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years, while its gas production is declining. \\n\\n\\nEdison rates to remain high under utility\\'s deal with state\\nBy KAREN GAUDETTE\\nAssociated Press Writer\\n\\n10/04/2001\\nAssociated Press Newswires\\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Consumer advocates warn that Southern California Edison customers, already saddled with last spring\\'s record rate increase until 2003, could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead. \\nThe deal secretly negotiated with the state Public Utilities Commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by Edison last November and is designed to keep the utility from following Pacific Gas and Electric, the state\\'s largest utility, into bankruptcy.\\nIt lets Edison pay off more than $3 billion of a $3.9 billion debt, in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last May for at least the next two years. \\nConsumer advocates, however, said Wednesday that other consequences of the state\\'s power crisis could send rates higher still. \\nThe state\\'s power-buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $43 billion of long-term power already contracted for delivery. \\nThe prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some Edison customers. \\n\"We can\\'t stay in business,\" said William Ho, general manager of Top Hat Cleaners in West Hollywood, where the monthly electric bill has gone from $600 before the state\\'s energy crisis to nearly $1,200. \"We would have to raise prices, and we\\'re already heading into a recession.\" \\nHo said Top Hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows. But he added, \"You can\\'t press clothes in the dark.\" \\nIt\\'s unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power-buying costs, said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group. \\nHoge and other consumer advocates said this week\\'s deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of Edison, which supported the state\\'s failed deregulation plan. \\n\"It\\'s like saying I\\'m not going to beat you any harder, so it shouldn\\'t hurt,\" she said. \\nJohn Bryson, Edison International president and chief executive officer, said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors. \\nEdison owes nearly $4 billion to hundreds of power companies, ranging from energy marketing giant Enron Corp. to the state Independent System Operator, manager of the state\\'s power grid. \\n\"The agreement means stability, predictability,\" he said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. \"It means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work.\" \\nThe PUC said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power-buyer. Commission President Loretta Lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let Edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy. \\n\"I think that this is a balanced compromise, but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt,\" she said. \\nThe state Department of Water Resources so far has spent $9 billion buying electricity for customers of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. \\nThe shareholder-owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers. The state\\'s 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers. \\nThat price cap was the focal point of Edison\\'s lawsuit against the PUC, with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers. \\nUnder the deal struck this week, Edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $1.2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt. The utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators, and that money also would have to help pay down the debt. \\nThe agreement now goes before U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los Angeles, who could rule on it this week. \\n\"Right now Judge Lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers. ... Will he pull out $3.3 billion for Edison or will he protect the working men and women of California who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax?\" said Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which organized a protest rally Wednesday outside the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. \\nHeller estimated the settlement could cost Edison ratepayers $750 each over the next four years. \\n--- \\nOn the Net: \\nhttp://www.sce.com \\nhttp://www.cpuc.ca.gov \\nhttp://www.turn.org\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BG India has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire Enron\\'s offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $388 million. \\nThe contract signed on Tuesday night with Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd involves purchase of the latter\\'s 30 per cent stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna-Mukta gas/oil fields besides the 62.64 per cent interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration block.\\nAddressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr Nigel Shaw, BG India Chief Executive Officer, said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeholders agreeing to BG as the operator of the exploration fields. \\nThe rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a 40 per cent stakeholder in the Panna-Mukta, Tapti fields, besides a 10 per cent stake in the CB-OS/1 exploration block, seeking operatorship of the fields. \\nWhen contacted, the ONGC Chairman, Mr Subir Raha, said, \"ONGC\\'s position remains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields. We are currently in talks with BG on the issue.\" \\n\"We are in talks with the Government as well as ONGC on the issue. We are not contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied,\" \\nMr Shaw replied when queried on the issue. He stressed that in case the other parties do not agree, the deal will fall through. \"We will walk away in such an event,\" he said. \\nOn the legality of ONGC\\'s claim, Mr Shaw said, \"under the agreement, at the point of change of control (from Enron to BG), the other stakeholders can object to the transfer of operatorship (to BG). However, the contract is not clear on the deadlock.\" \\nMr Shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end of the month. \\nCurrently, in the Tapti and Panna-Mukta gas fields, Reliance Industries Ltd holds 30 per cent stake while ONGC holds 40 per cent equity. In the case of the CB-OS/1 exploration field, Hindustan Oil and Exploration Company holds 17.36 per cent, Tata Petrodyne 10 per cent and ONGC 10 per cent. \\nThe BG vision: BG plans to double the gas production capacity of the Tapti gas fields by 2004, according to Mr Shaw. Though not willing to reveal the quantum of investment in the future, he said that BG would be committed to its share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on CB-OS/1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in December. \\n\"There is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this.\" \\nBG will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset (exploration field). However, the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields. Currently, the fields yield 70 million standard cu.feet of gas per day and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. \\nBG has a 50 per cent stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd, a gas supply company in Mumbai. Further, it is in the process of setting up an LNG regassification terminal in Pipavav. \\nBG is not interested in buying out Enron\\'s upcoming LNG regassification facility at Dabhol since it is setting up its own LNG regassification terminal at Pipavav, Gujarat, Mr Shaw said. \\nMr Shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields, there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the LNG terminal and that from the exploration fields. \\nOn the pricing front, the Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004. Beyond this period, the pricing is internationally linked. \\nOnce the deal is completed, BG India plans to initiate talks with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and ONGC to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture, according to Mr Shaw. \\nFurther, it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in London as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum. \\nBG has so far invested $150 million in its ventures in the country. \\n- Our Bureau\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tom Ridge, who was named by President Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks to head a new Cabinet-level Office of Homeland Security. \\nThe new office will coordinate the efforts of more than 40 government agencies in tightening domestic security and rooting out terrorist threats. \\nWhite was named to serve as the Pentagon\\'s liaison by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on Tuesday. \\nWhite is a retired Army brigadier general who became the Army\\'s top civilian executive in May. Before he was nominated for the Army post by Bush, White was vice chairman of Houston-based Enron Energy Services. \\n\"In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, homeland security has emerged as a paramount national priority,\" White said. \"As the Department of Defense executive agent for homeland security, I look forward to working closely with Gov. Tom Ridge as he leads this vital effort.\" \\nA 23-year veteran of the Army, White served as executive assistant to Gen. Colin Powell while Powell headed the Joint Chiefs of Staff under former President Bush. Powell currently is secretary of state. \\n\\n\\nBritish Gas to buy Enron\\'s oil, gas assets for $388 m\\nOur Corporate Bureau New Delhi\\n\\n10/04/2001\\nBusiness Standard\\n1\\nCopyright (c) Business Standard\\n\\nBritish Gas India today announced that it has reached an agreement to buy the assets of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd for $388 million. The assets include a 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas fields as well as a 62.64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the CB-OS/1 block. All three are located on the west coast of India and are operated by Enron. \\nHowever, British Gas India chief executive officer Nigel Shaw said the deal is subject to the condition that British Gas gets operational control of the fields. \"If we are not the operator, we will walk away from the deal,\" he said. The deal, signed in London last night, would require clearance from the Indian government. Shaw revealed that British Gas India has already initiated a dialogue with the government for this.\\nBut the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it has dried. The state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) which has a 40 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by Enron Oil & Gas. \\nHowever, petroleum minister Ram Naik said \"all issues will be sorted out in due course\". \"Enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal. We will examine the issue,\" he said. \\nAccording to oil industry sources, the operatorship is based on a consensus_and not on the percentage of shares held_among shareholders. The proposed sale of Enron\\'s assets does not \"mean an automatic transfer of operatorship and the shareholders will have to come to a consensus,\" ONGC sources claim. \\nWhat is more, ONGC had earlier unsuccessfully bid $350 million for Enron\\'s oil and gas assets. ONGC has the first right of refusal, according to an ONGC official. ONGC chairman S Raha was unavailable for comment. \\nShaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of operating the oil and gas fields. \\n\"We are in active discussion with both ONGC and Reliance. We are hopeful of wrapping it up by the end of this month,\" Shaw said. \\nAn ONGC official, however, said the state-owned company was aware of the development but had not been informed officially by Enron. \\nShaw also disclosed that British Gas was willing to make further investments to ramp up production at the Tapti and the Panna/Mukta fields. \\n\"Further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree. We are looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004,\" he said. \\nWhen asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise, Shaw said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. \\nThe three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meters of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil a day. \\nAn Enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a Reliance spokesman. \\nEnron Oil & Gas has 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas and Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, ONGC has a 40 per cent interest and Reliance has the remaining 30 per cent. \\nIn the case of CB-OS/1, the other partners are Hindustan Oil Exploration Company with 17.36 per cent and Tata Petrodyne and ONGC with 10 per cent each.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

I recently changed the standard ECB slate of directors of the Caycos=20\\ndirectly owned by Enron Caribbean Basin LLC, to reflect the standard ESA=20\\nslate of directors.  These Caycos all relate to projects or assets in=20\\nColombia and Venezuela. =20\\n\\n2. Early this week Nancy Muchmore mentioned that the new slate of directors=\\n=20\\nwould be put into place: Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzalez (replacing Bannantine an=\\nd=20\\nChristodoulou), Derrick and Walls. Today=01,s email from David Delainey sta=\\ntes=20\\nthat Enron Global Assets =01) South America will work in close coordination=\\n with=20\\nEnron Americas. However with these recent re-organization announcements,=20\\nwould this new slate that Nancy mentioned, apply to the Enron Global Assets=\\n =01)=20\\nSouth America group? Perhaps, upper management should consider naming some=\\n=20\\nkey individual(s) in the South America Assets group to the slate.  I believ=\\ne=20\\nthat we should keep it simply with one standard slate in place (in case we=\\n=20\\nreorganize again), but adding at least some one from the assets side. =20\\n\\n3. I was about to move the mentioned Caycos directly owned by Enron Caribbe=\\nan=20\\nBasin LLC under Enron South America LLC when the new re-organization was=20\\nannounced.  I will need a directive from Legal as well as from Tax where to=\\n=20\\nmove these entities. =20\\n\\n4. Also, there is a list of Caycos (set up for bid purposes in Colombia and=\\n=20\\nVenezuela) that management has reviewed and approved to be dissolved.  I pl=\\nan=20\\nto provide that list to Tax for their review and approval. =20\\n\\n5. Another point to address is the standard slate of directors/officers of=\\n=20\\nthose Delaware entities (that have operations in Latin America) which have=\\n=20\\nHaug, Cumberland, Castagnola and Sayre named as Directors/Officers.  A=20\\ndecision has to be made who are going to replace these individuals. =20\\n\\nI await your instructions.\\n\\nDenise\\n_______________________________\\nDenise G.

Seattle should roll up good \\nnumbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the \\nyear.   \\n\\n Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos\\' pass defense \\nis one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a \\nchance to shine this week.   \\n\\n Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 \\n Avoid Seattle\\'s defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced \\nDenver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith \\nembarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  \\n\\n John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Carney won\\'t be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard \\ntime moving the ball into Baltimore\\'s end of the field.  \\n\\n Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San \\nDiego\\'s top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  \\n\\n Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Don\\'t expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore\\'s \\ndefense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more \\ndecorated backs all season long.   \\n\\n Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more \\nproblems on Sunday. The Ravens\\' stellar defense will surely knock him around \\nall day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no \\ncirumstances should you start him.    \\n\\n Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the \\noverworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and \\nspeedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   \\n\\n Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 \\n Don\\'t expect a solid performance from the Raiders\\' defense this week. \\nCharles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might \\nbe able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  \\n\\n Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 \\n The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be \\ntoo much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key \\nthird-down target.  \\n\\n Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 \\n The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. \\nThe Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets \\nin the red zone.   \\n\\n Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \\n Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him \\nin coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  \\n\\n Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland\\'s offense this week. \\nTyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may \\nneed to use Crockett often against the Jets.   \\n\\n Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 \\n Gannon might be Oakland\\'s most productive player this week. Look for him to \\npick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim \\nBrown.   \\n\\n Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \\n Denver\\'s defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of \\ntrouble handling Seattle\\'s Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than \\n200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   \\n\\n Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 \\n The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against \\nthe Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn\\'t present much of a threat to the front seven \\nand the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on \\nSteve Beuerlein.  \\n\\n Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The \\nKansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few \\nchances to kick against Carolina.  \\n\\n Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 \\n Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an \\naccomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn\\'t do much else and won\\'t help \\nmany Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  \\n\\n Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 \\n Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar \\nTE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not \\nbe able to contain him over the middle.  \\n\\n Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 \\n Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. \\nCBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep \\nroutes.  \\n\\n Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 \\n Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He \\nshould be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  \\n\\n Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his \\ninjured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage \\nto Stewart\\'s knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as \\na strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants \\ndefense.  \\n\\n Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \\n Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will \\nhave no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  \\n\\n Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \\n Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform \\nwell against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the \\nmiddle.     \\n\\n Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 \\n Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good \\nnumbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   \\n\\n Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 \\n Watters missed Thursday\\'s practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to \\nplay Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from \\nscrimmage and scored a touchdown.  \\n\\n Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 \\n Graham won\\'t need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last \\nweek. He is listed as questionable for Sunday\\'s game and is an extremely \\nrisky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore \\ndefense.  \\n\\n Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 \\n Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that \\nspot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used \\nin short-yardage situations. Unless you\\'re desperate, don\\'t start any Kansas \\nCity RBs.  \\n\\n Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \\n Christie was held without a point in last week\\'s game against the Dolphins, \\nbut don\\'t expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid \\nFantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between \\ntwo teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  \\n\\n Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 \\n Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the \\nKansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. \"I \\nmissed the majority of camp, so there\\'s not that much wear and tear on me, \\nbut it\\'s still a long season,\" he said. \"It\\'s not so bad physically.

Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is \\ntargeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is \\ndirectly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to \\n970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan \\nLateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.',\n",

Upon deplaning, I called Kelly Johnson but could not join the board meeting because I was unable to find a fixed line.  I phoned Paula Rieker after getting home to receive an update of the meeting.  Apparently the session ended right at the time I rang Kelly.  \\nTwo thoughts: to bring in either as a director or as an advisor a highly reputable financial person such as Bob Rubin is a good idea.  If Bob (whom I saw last Friday in Shanghai) cannot do it, you may consider Felix Rohatyn.  He was of course the person in 1975 who bailed out the financial crisis of New York City.  Until recently, he was U.S. Ambassador to France.  I know him personally but not well.  However, another friend Peter Goldmark who is chairman, CEO and publisher of the International Herald Tribune knows Felix very well.  Peter told me that he was excellent in crisis situations.  Together with his financial savvy and reputation, maybe he can be considered by Enron at this time.  Coincidentally, Peter was head of the New York Port Authority in the late 70's and early 80's.\\nAt the October 24 board meeting, you told us about Jeff Skilling's phone call right beforehand.  Could it be that knowing that the board would not invite him back, he was offering himself just to give the impression of not having left us in anticipation of the present problems?  If so, then we should not turn him down right away.  Perhaps we should somehow make him not want to come back.  Maybe this is too convoluted.  \\nKen, these are difficult times but I am pleased that the board is acting in unison.  After the problems are over, I still think that my suggestion to you during the last board dinner in Houston should be looked into, i.e. have a strategy retreat where the board can have thorough discussions on the many fundamental aspects of our business.  Present difficulties only point to that need.  But for now, let us get over the immediate hurdle first.  \\nSincerely, \\nRonnie Chan \\nP.S.    Since I have spoken to Norm about the strategy retreat, I am copying this letter to him.\",\n",

As per our internal meeting on Wednesday, I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation based upon the data provided thus far.  Enron has provided Duke with the Gathering Agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.  I informed Stephen that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering  line.  We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream.\\n\\nStephen informed me that Duke's evaluation to date showed a value in the $14 to 15 MM range.  Stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation.  However, based upon the notional value Duke has derived,  it appears that Duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor Enron is using.  I stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value.\\n\\nBased upon this discussion with Duke, I would recommend that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get Marathon approval for release of the Production Handing Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA.\\n\\nIf you have any questions please give me a call at ext. 33541.\\n\\n\\nThanks  ... Kevin\",\n",

We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various \\nMidcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to \\nReliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport \\ncontract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether \\nthe gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, \\nis:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are \\nconsidered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered \\nto them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?\\n\\nI am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the \\ncorrect transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be \\nif I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas \\ninto Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I \\nwould also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the \\nChristmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough \\nleverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?\\n\\nThanks for your help.\",\n",

Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia\\'s $.27 \\ngathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any \\ngathering.

Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  \\n\\nOn Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  \\n\\nWe are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.\\n\\nIf you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.\",\n",

My doctors visit yesterday confirmed that the blockage has returned and some action is recommended to try and correct it.  The problem is that actions short of a by-pass leave a 40% chance of a second recurrence.

Thank you.\\n\\nThis is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.\\n\\nBackground:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.\\n\\nOften times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.\\n\\nRequest Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?\\n\\nThank you in advance.\\n\\nMonica Clay\\nx 57227'},\n",

       "  'Body': \"Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis\\nBy Michael B. Marois \\nSacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. \\nThe governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. \\nSouthern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. \\nThe Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. \\nThe latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.\",\n",

Why would Questar spend the money if they aren't sure there will be any take away capacity at the border?\\n\\nHope all is well Kim!\\n\\nMike McGowan\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tBrennan, Lorna  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 4:38 PM\\nTo:\\tHass, Glen; Chavez, Gabriel; Dickerson, Steve V; Dowd, Stephen; Gadd, Eric; Gelin, Elberg; Gonzalez, Martin; Hyatt, Kevin; Junus, David; Lee, Jebong; Millar, John; Ratner, Michael; Harris, Steven; Donoho, Lindy; Goradia, Pallavi; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Lokay, Michelle; McConnell, Mark; Moore, Jan; Watson, Kimberly; Y'Barbo, Paul; Huber, Lee; Pryor, Tony; McGowan, Mike W.\\nSubject:\\tSouthern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion\\n\\nState Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails \\nSalt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. \\nIt is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. \\nWhether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.\"},\n",

Mutual non-solicitation agreement will not be\\naccepted by Enron.  It is corporate policy not to enter into these\\nagreements because they are unenforceable internally (we are just too\\nlarge and recruit too many people to track them).  Certainly, we will\\nnot use the partnership to recruit your people, but can not commit to\\nthat in writing.\\n\\n  Second, the term of the confidentiality agreement is quite long (3\\nyears).  In the high tech world this is considered a quite long.  I\\nthink our attorneys like to keep these shorter (again for tracking\\npurposes).

       "  'Body': \"Justin -\\n\\nFurther to our conversation yesterday I have reviewed the existing HDD Swap \\nGTC's.  In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are \\ndrafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been \\nexecuted,  the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the \\nISDA framework.  The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation \\nfor each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form.   I have \\nmade some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the \\ncarve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC's will only \\napply if an ISDA has been executed. \\n\\nIncidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the \\nrelevant GTC's will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in \\nplace on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make \\nany provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered \\ninto subsequent to the execution of a Transaction.   In such circumstances on \\na literal interpretation of the ETA, the pre-existing Transaction would \\ncontinued to be governed by the GTC but future Transactions would be governed \\nby the ISDA/Master Agreement.  From a netting perspective this is not ideal.  \\nIs this the intention ?\\n\\nGive me a shout when you have had a chance to review the attached.\\n\\nDenis\"},\n",

Here are my findings:\\n\\nPreSchedule Workspace:\\n\\nI was forced to choose East or West:  good.\\n\\nThe error-check feature found the following problems:\\n\\tIncorrectly spelled Counterparty short names\\n\\tMissing Sched term \\n\\tMissing Border 1 \\n\\tMissing Sched Hour \\n\\tMissing Supply or Market Price\\n\\tMissing Supply or Market  Cont. Term\\n\\tMissing Time Zone\\n\\tMissing Supply  or Market MW\\n\\n\\nError Check did not see the following errors:\\n\\tMissing Supply OR Market deal numbers\\n\\tMissing Physical or Non-Physical designation\\n\\nDuring my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet.  When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying \"List index out of bounds (2)\". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message \"List index out of bounds (3)\". \\n\\nThe confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation.\\n\\nRouting took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.\\n\\n\\nPath Confirmation:\\n\\nNot forced to choose East or West on this:\\n\\nUnable to test this with the new data as none was displayed.  I will test as soon as I get word that I can.\\n\\nPlease let me know what you find, here is the sheet that I ran.\\n\\n\\n << File: june23midc.psc >> \\nCara',\n",

The topic of today\\'s panel was \"RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.\"  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  \\n\\nPanel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\\n\\nThe morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O\\'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  \\n\\nEnergy Spot Market\\n\\nThere was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  \\n\\nDay Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules\\n\\nMost of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.\\n\\nICAP Requirement\\n\\nMost of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  \\n\\nMark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.\\n\\n Standardized Markets\\n\\n Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.\\n\\nMassey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.\\n\\nPanel Two:  Optional RTO Markets\\n\\nThe afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).\\n\\nThis panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.\\n\\nMandatory Markets\\n\\nOther than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.\\n\\n ICAP\\n\\n Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.\\n\\nPat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.\\n\\nShelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.\\n\\nDay Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.\\n\\nPlease call me with questions or comments.\\n\\nSarah',\n",

       "  'Body': 'Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might \\ninterest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just \\naccepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a \\nbank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if \\nhe knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that \\nwe should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very \\nbright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at \\nFleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist \\nrole as she learned Enron and would then \"earn\" her way into managing special \\nprojects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.  \\nIf you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral \\nalong to other HR groups.  \\n\\nFYI - James will start work here on April 3.  \\n---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 03/09/2000 12:43 PM \\n---------------------------\\n\\n\\n\"James Scribner\" <JSCRIBN@email.fleming.com> on 03/08/2000 11:18:40 AM\\nTo: <sally.beck@enron.com>\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Resume for Tana Cashion\\n\\n\\nSally,\\n\\nAttached is the resume for Tana Cashion.

       "  'Body': 'Southern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline \\nproject consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from \\nARCO.  Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder \\nwould be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.  The pipeline \\nsystem would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.  The East Zone, \\nwhich will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will \\nhave 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity.  The West Zone, wholly within \\nCalifornia, will have 120,000 Dth/d.  \\n\\nSouthern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July \\n28,2000.  An optional certificate application does not require any showing of \\nmarket need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to \\nOct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of \\ndemand.  The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the \\ncapacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with \\nits affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East \\nZone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service \\nagreements of 5 and 10 year terms are \"being negotiated\" with prospective \\nshippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in \\nboth the East and West zones.  \\n\\nTW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has \\nbeen filed.  I have no further information about any further subscription of \\ncapacity.  I also have no information regarding any progress that has been \\nmade on construction.\\nIf you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at FERC, \\nor if you have any other questions, please let me know and I\\'ll see what I \\ncan find.  I\\'ve got the entire environmental report in my office if we need \\nthat for any reason!',\n",

We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  \\n\\n2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis. \\n\\nMaria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV\\'d or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.\\n\\nPlease set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)

It is difficult to estimate likely turnout at the event - \\nhowever the opposition Platform has been placing ads and has organised \\nseveral buses from outside villages.  We are in contact with the Arcos Town \\nHall to see if they will be issuing official attendance numbers in advance of \\nthe opposition group, which can be sure to distort numbers.\\n\\nOur PR consultant is in contact today with local media and will be in Arcos \\nat the weekend to gauge the mood - if the demonstration does not attract many \\nsupporters, we will not comment publicly.  However, we will assess the \\nsituation on Sunday, and if there is a very large turnout, we may set up some \\ninterviews for Ignacio Soneira during the afternoon with local press and \\nradio.  These interviews will be used to communicate that: Enron continues to \\nbelieve in the positive benefits of the project for the region; the project \\nhas been subject to extensive public consultation; we have obtained our \\nEnvironmental Impact Declaration and a large number of other permits; \\ndifferent opinions are to be welcomed in a democracy, and in fact the project \\ndoes have support from many parts of the local community.\\n\\nIt is important to note that local politicians are setting great store by the \\nsuccess or otherwise of this weekend's demonstration - one key factor will be \\nthe ratio of Arcos residents present versus outsiders.  We will be continuing \\nwith our ongoing PR activities - adverts, presentations, sponsorships, \\ninterviews etc - next week, so that we are not seen to be backing off from \\nthe project following the demonstration.\\n\\nSome local politicians are predicting that the level of turnout may in the \\nend depend on the weather.  \\n\\n\\nTordesillas\\n\\nThe demonstration which took place a few days ago in Tordesillas did attract \\na large number of local people (in the thousands).  The Tordesillas Mayor has \\nnow said that if local people are against the plant, then she too is against \\nthe project.  Our media response on this issue is that the consultation \\nprocess is ongoing and that the Environmental Impact Report is due out within \\nthe next few weeks.  \\n\\nThe demonstration and the Mayor's position has attracted substantial local \\npress coverage - the obvious concern is that these latest developments get \\npicked up by newswires (one energy publication has picked up on the \\nsituation) and spread through Spain to Arcos.\\n\\nJackie Gentle and I will be visiting Tordesillas and Arcos next week to \\ndiscuss the latest developments.\"},\n",

       "  'Body': 'Not necessarily for purposes of discussion on the SCE call, but for later\\nreference if we have to fight SCE over the justification for their crediting\\nproposal, I want to chime in with my critique of SCE\\'s analysis.  \\n\\nFirst of all, their example does not properly characterize the obligations\\nof the direct access customers.  A Direct access customer (with the same\\nhypothetical load as in the SCE example) did not pay the same $60 toward\\nSCE\\'s procurement costs and transition recovery, they paid a lesser sum, $60\\nminus the actual PX costs for that billing cycle.  What the direct access\\ncustomer paid (assuming the PX costs were $30), was a contribution directly\\nto CTC transition cost recovery, in this case $30.   \\n\\nWhen the price of energy exceeded the 6 cents in bundled rates for\\nprocurement and transition cost recovery, the utility does begin to build an\\nundercollection from its bundled customers, and the entire $80\\nundercollection in the SCE example relates to the cost of power purchased\\nfor the bundled customer but not recovered in rates.\\n\\nThe same is NOT TRUE for the direct access customer.  The negative credit\\nprovided to the direct access customer is the same as the underrecovery from\\nthe bundled service customer, in this case $80.  However, for the direct\\naccess customer, this amount has nothing to do with power purchased by the\\nutility for the DA customer, and represents essentially a credit against\\namounts overpaid toward the utility\\'s CTC recovery in earlier periods.  \\n\\nThis is one of the many perverse effects of the residual CTC collection\\nmechanism.  If a fixed CTC contribution had been established from Day 1,\\ndirect access customers could have continued to pay that fixed contribution,\\nalso pay their $40 share of the utility T&D costs, and would not have had\\nany role in creating the utility\\'s undercollection.  However, because the\\nCTC calculation was a residual calculation:  the generation component of the\\nfrozen rates less the actual PX costs = CTC (which later became negative)\\ndirect access customers\\' contribution to CTC was dependent on the utility\\'s\\nprocurement risk in the market compared to the generation component in\\nfrozen rates.  This was also consistent with the notion contained in AB 1890\\nand the Edison MOU that the utility bore the risk of power price volatility\\nin recovering its CTC.\\n\\nIn order for direct access customers to contribute to CTC symmetrically with\\nbundled customers, when bundled customers no longer contributed to CTC\\n(because of high power costs) and in fact REDUCED the CTC collected (the\\npower cost undercollection was to have been paid first before CTC was\\nbooked, but the PUC did not properly account for this until it adopted the\\nTURN accounting adjustment), then the CTC contribution of direct access\\ncustomers had to be proportionately reduced, and that is the function of the\\nnegative CTC credit.\\n\\nThus, a reduction in the CTC contribution of direct access customers to\\nensure they paid the same proportionate share of CTC as bundled customers is\\nNOT a matter which SCE is entitled to recover after the fact because they\\nsustained an undercollection of power costs.  The undercollection of power\\ncosts was entirely their risk, and direct access customers paid their fair\\nshare of CTC and that is all they had to pay, period.  The fact that they\\npaid less than SCE expected because the high power costs generated a lot of\\nnegative CTC credits at the end of the transition period is one more risk\\nthat the utilities assumed when they selfishly and foolishly promoted a\\nresidual CTC calculation instead of a fixed transition cost recovery system\\nas was used in most other states.  SCE is entitled to NO recovery of its\\nundercollection from direct access customers.\\n\\nAs you can tell, I am more than willing to discuss this ad infinitum.  If\\nyou have questions, please call or email.  \\n\\nMike Day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Steffes, James D.

SCE had to\\nbuy power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA\\ncustomers.  SCE\\'s purchases of the power to serve the bundled load\\ncoupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was\\nthe direct reason for the undercollection. I can make the argument that\\nthe undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.\\n\\nThere are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.\\nI will explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 --\\npayments of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real\\ndelay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off.\\nOne of the tradeoffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR\\nHIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there\\nwere high gas prices or bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed\\nand not collect their billions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That\\'s the risk\\nthey agreed to.  Now, they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that\\nmoney and more.  This is in direct conflict with the statute. I can make\\nthe argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and\\ntherefore any undercollection is theirs alone -- now the CPUC can bail\\nthem out -- but that doesn\\'t make ESPs subject to any presumed\\n\"undercollection.\"\\n\\nNow to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to\\ndo a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and\\nthe retail busness from T&D. So, they did a \"top-down\" calculation.\\nThis meant that there had to be a \"credit\" put on the bills of DA\\ncustomers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the\\ncustomers switch to DA. So, the PX Credit structure was a direct result\\nof the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the\\nrates.  Next, although bundled customers rates were capped, the\\ndecisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for\\nDA customers -- their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by\\ntheir ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed their tariffs with the\\nCPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor\\nauthorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got nowhere, until\\nWPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our argument\\nwas that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers\\n-- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities\\navoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is\\nfundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have\\nthought we had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The\\nsettlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone\\nunderstood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to\\nallow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were\\nhigh. So, we have a legal right to receive the full PX Credit/Negative\\nCTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated\\nwith bundled customers. It seems as if we should be able to prosecute\\nthis legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an attorney) \\n\\nIn summary, we have leverage and should use it.\\n\\nSue\\n\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff \\nSent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 11:12 AM\\nTo: Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael;\\nHuddleson, Diann; Swain, Steve; Curry, Wanda; \\'mday@gmssr.com\\'\\nSubject: Proposal Edison Is Distributing to ESPs\\n\\n\\nFYI.\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Matt.Pagano@sce.com [mailto:Matt.Pagano@sce.com]\\nSent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 1:05 PM\\nTo: Dasovich, Jeff\\nSubject: DA Credit \\n\\n\\nHi Jeff,\\n\\nPlease find below SCE\\'s proposal to settle past Direct Access Credit\\nissues\\nand determine the Direct Access Credit going forward.

In addition to \\nmy sister\\'s involvement in this fund raiser, my brother Steven was diagnosed \\nseveral years ago with Adult On-Set Juvenile Diabetes and I have seen first \\nhand what a terrible disease this can be to manage.  There is good news, as \\nmany of you know.  The research in this area has made great strides in recent \\nyears and I am encouraged that someday soon there will be a cure.\\n\\nIn this regard, I would truly appreciate any contribution that each of you \\nmight be able to make.  Something as small as $5.00 would be great. (although \\nif your pockets are full and you want to give more that is ok too)  I would \\nbe forever grateful if, through the donations that I am able to collect, I am \\nable to make a difference.  Please feel free to send your checks via \\ninter-office mail or stop by if you wish.  Thank you for your consideration.\\n\\nWith much appreciation,\\n\\nStuart',\n",

       "  'Body': \"I assume the issue is TGS (instead of CGS)\\nI will call you after sending this mail.\\nBelow is a small analysis related to the convertibility Law and TGS.=20\\n\\n\\n1. Argentina Convertibility Law No 23,928.\\n\\nThe Convertibility Law passed on March 1991 determined the following:\\n? Established a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and the national=20\\ncurrency (1 dollar =3D 10,000 Australes, latter defined as equal to 1 peso)\\n? The Central Bank (Argentine Federal Reserve) must permanently have=20\\ninternational reserves (dollars, gold, other currencies) available to back=\\n=20\\n100% of the monetary base. The Central Bank must sell all required dollars =\\nat=20\\nthe fixed exchange rate.\\n? It is forbidden any price adjustment clause by an index.\\n? For all transactions agreed upon before the Law, prices could not be larg=\\ner=20\\nthan the contractual price, adjusted by the exchange rate variation plus 12=\\n%=20\\na year (section 9). This section affected contracts in force.\\n? The Convertibility Law was just amended on June 22nd 2001 by the Law 2544=\\n5,=20\\nto equal 1 peso to the simple average of 1 dollar and 1 euro. Anyway,=20\\naccording to its section 2, the new Convertibility rule will only be in for=\\nce=20\\nonce the price market of 1 dollar is equal to 1 euro (to avoid a surprise=\\n=20\\ndevaluation).\\n\\n2. Legal requirements for a devaluation\\n\\nTo modify the exchange rate before 1 dollar =3D 1 euro, it would be necessa=\\nry=20\\nto abolish or amend again the Convertibility Law.\\nIn such regards, the Congress would have to abolish the Convertibility Law =\\nor=20\\nkeep the Convertibility at a different exchange rate.=20\\nAlthough in principle a devaluation should not affect contracts with prices=\\n=20\\nset in dollars, even the Convertibility Law has affected contracts that wer=\\ne=20\\nin force.\\nSo, there is a certain risk that a new eventual amendment of the=20\\nConvertibility Law could affect contracts in force.\\nIn fact I think there is a higher risk of the government breaching the=20\\ncontracts or defaulting debt payments than devaluating the currency by=20\\nsurprise.\\n\\n3. Impact on TGS\\nSince the privatization rules establish that TGS=01, rates are in dollars, =\\na=20\\ndevaluation that respects contracts in force should not have a significant=\\n=20\\nimpact on TGS financial results.\\nHowever, due to the social impact of a devaluation, the Congress could pass=\\n a=20\\nnew law establishing a new mechanism to calculate Public Utilities rates. T=\\nhe=20\\nhigher the percentage of devaluation (and the higher the social turmoil), t=\\nhe=20\\nhigher is the probability that this kind of Law would be passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRichard Shapiro\\n07/15/2001 06:32 PM\\n\\n\\nTo: Guillermo Canovas/SA/Enron@Enron\\ncc: =20\\nSubject: Please read- Argentina economic risk\\n\\nLet's discuss.\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron on 07/15/2001=\\n=20\\n04:36 PM ---------------------------\\nFrom: Robert Johnston/ENRON@enronXgate on 07/12/2001 10:54 AM\\nTo: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron\\ncc: Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Brendan=20\\nFitzsimmons/ENRON@enronXgate, Scott Tholan/ENRON@enronXgate=20\\n\\nSubject: Please read- Argentina economic risk\\n\\nHi Rick- Kevin Hannon asked that we contact you to coordinate some market=\\n=20\\nintelligence research pertaining to the deepening financial crisis in=20\\nArgentina.

We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. \\n\\nThis is more than just a legal issue; it\\'s going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.\\n\\nAs we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties\\' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin\\'s response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA\\'s behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.\\n\\nFrom the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds\\' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. \\n\\nFrom the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. \\n\\nThe point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.\\n\\nThese are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we\\'re missing from the sides that I\\'ve mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. \\nRegards,\\nRuss\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tWhite, Bill  \\nSent:\\tThursday, September 27, 2001 3:32 PM\\nTo:\\tDyk, Russell\\nSubject:\\tFW: Trades as ENA\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tSharma, Shifali  \\nSent:\\t26 July 2001 08:21\\nTo:\\tWhite, Bill\\nSubject:\\tFW: Trades as ENA\\n\\nThis is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. \\n\\nTo avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.\\n\\nAnother alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.\\n\\nNote that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).\\n\\nRegards\\nJanine\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tBeyhum, Maya  \\nSent:\\t25 July 2001 14:13\\nTo:\\tJuggins, Janine; Boyd, Justin\\nCc:\\tSharma, Shifali\\nSubject:\\tTrades as ENA\\n\\nHi\\n\\nI am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.\\n\\nAt the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.\\n\\nWe were wondering about a couple of things:\\n\\nAre there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do\\nIs there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?\\n\\nThanks for your help\\nMaya',\n",

UAE \\nwill own and operate the plant and ENA will have option on the output for \\nabout 3 to 5 years. The O&M cost estimate shown assumes the hire of 2 O&M \\ntechs to cover the LM6000 plant for the 2 peak period shifts. Current staff \\nat UAE plant is reported as 7 total (including admin) which seems low for a \\ncogen, so I\\'ve shown the addition of 2 techs. It assumes an allocation of \\nsome existing labor and admin/operating costs from the existing plant, but in \\nno case is the \"annual total\" for the fixed costs more than 1/2 of what we \\ncould do it for ourselves if it was \"stand alone\". Maintenance and chemicals \\nare shown as variable. The fees are shown for what we used for the Wilton \\nCenter Expansion ($40M - Mob; $80M - Annual Ops).\\n\\n\\n\\nthanks, Scot',\n",

Wire transfer received \\ntoday.  I have called Montauk and informed them and withdrawn from further \\nnegotiations with them.  FYI - we never accepted their offer.\\nAustin PPA - was sold to EDI for $150K.  Wire transfer received yesterday.\\nSteve and Geoff are pursuing the sale of the blower and flare from the Austin \\nproject, potential $30K.\\nCurrent cash projection (based solely on money in the bank) through the week \\nending Nov. 3 is + $135K.  The rent for the Austin office for Oct has been \\npaid.  This number also includes $20K for Nov\\'s rent (due 11/1).  This \\nprovides some breathing room (time-wise) to continue trying to execute the \\nstrategy of an orderly liquidation in order to maximize Ecogas\\' ability to \\nsatisfy its obligations with its creditors.  \\nOur meeting today with ZAPCO re: the purchase of the company via a stock swap \\nwent ok but my confidence level a deal can be done in the timeframe required \\nis very low due to complications on their part.  We are exploring another \\nstructural option - at ZAPCO\\'s request.  The ball is in their court and they \\nknow we are continuing to pursue other alternatives.\\nDiscussions with Inter-Asia Venture Management (IAVM) continue to both \\nprogress and expand.  In addition to Rosenberg IAVM has expressed a direct \\ninterest in Ecovest and McCommas.  Considering McCommas represents the bulk \\nof current value, IAVM has now elevated their interest to buying Ecogas Corp. \\nas a whole rather than on a piecemeal basis.  Again, the ball is in their \\ncourt and they are demonstrating a real sense of urgency to make something \\nhappen.  They are well aware of the time constraints.\\nFrito-Lay/McCommas Bluff - F/L senior management does not want to \"get into \\nthe landfill energy business\" (at least directly) and brought in a third \\nparty intermediary.  After detailed discussions and due diligence on their \\npart, the third party was not willing to put forth a formal offer.  Their \\nintermediary does not have the capital to close the deal and is not willing \\nto put his current assets at risk.  As a result, we have escalated \\ndiscussions with another entity who could provide the same interface with F/L \\nand whom would be acceptable by F/L.  This will also be dependent on the \\nprobability of the IAVM and/or ZAPCO discussion referenced above.\\nSkyline/Westside - a bid request package was sent out to approximately 8 or 9 \\nindustry participants with bids due 10/23.  To date only one company \\nresponded with a very low bid and a lot of \"contingencies.\"  There are at \\nleast 2 other companies who called and expressed interest in bidding but have \\nnot yet submitted their bids.  EDI has requested permission to visit with WMI \\ndirectly and get a read on the Gas Rights Agreements and their willingness to \\nwork with them.  At this point, I don\\'t think we should agree.  Depending on \\nhow discussions with IAVM and/or ZAPCO progress, this will require a \\njudgement call as to whether or not we should proceed with this transaction.  \\nAny input from the rest?\\nFYI - Felipe Vega, the controller for Ecogas, has tendered his resignation \\neffective Monday, Oct. 30.  Kelly Mahmoud will assume the necessary role to \\nkeep things in order.\\n\\nGiven the updates above, we are still pursuing parallel and simultaneous \\npaths of either selling the company outright or strategically liquidating \\nassets with our focus on McCommas Bluff.  Feel free to call if you have any \\nquestions or would like to discuss in more detail.'},\n",

Thanks.\\n Al Larsen\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Alan Larsen/PDX/ECT on 12/12/2000 08:37 \\nAM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nDale Rasmussen\\n12/11/2000 07:30 PM\\nTo: Alan Larsen/PDX/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Re: CO#6 for Fountain Valley  \\n\\nThe way the process works as I understand it, is this:\\n\\nLast week we developed forms of breakout contracts for each of the turbine \\n\"groups\" (1 for LV, 1 for Fountain Valley, etc.).\\n\\nIn order to accomplish changes to the individual breakout contracts \\nreflecting changes to project-specific turbines, it was decided that rather \\nthan issue any additional change orders under the master (24 unit) contract, \\neither (a) the individual breakout contracts would be modified prior to \\nexecution to reflect the changed information; or (b) change orders would be \\nissued under the individual breakout contract.\\n\\nI worked with the crew last week on the form of breakout contract for the LV \\nturbines.  I haven\\'t done any change orders under that contract.\\n\\nAs I interpret the attachment below, the required modification is to change \\nthe reference from CO#6 to the master contract to CO #1 to the Fountain \\nValley breakout contract.  Of course, I may be missing something here.\\n\\nI did an earlier change order to the master contract that I could forward, if \\nthat would help.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlan Larsen\\n12/11/2000 04:43 PM\\nTo: Dale Rasmussen/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re: CO#6 for Fountain Valley\\n\\nDale--I understand that you have done Ge change orders breaking out the LV \\nCogen equip.

Any possibility for a \\ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\ndifficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\ndisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n \\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n \\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\nCurrent Projected \\nBlended IR:  5.38%\\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\nidea  earlier in the crisis.\\n \\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \\nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \\npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \\nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \\nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.'},\n",

Long-Term Contracts Jeopardized\\nBy Mark Golden\\n\\n05/18/2001\\nDow Jones Energy Service\\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nA Dow Jones Newswires Column \\n\\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Those looking for even the slightest bit of good news \\nfor the state of California can find it in Friday\\'s San Jose Mercury News. \\n\"California is in danger of losing more than 40% of the power it has lined up \\nin long-term contracts,\" says the lead of a major article, because \\nRepublicans in the state legislature didn\\'t back the $12.5 billion bond deal \\nlast week.\\nGetting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen to \\nCalifornia in a long time. \\nSince the state went on its long-term buying binge, forward prices for power \\nin the western U.S. have been falling steadily. Gov. Gray Davis announced $43 \\nbillion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on March 5. Contracts for summer \\npower at Palo Verde, Ariz., a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of \\npower into California, have fallen to $390 a megawatt-hour from a high of \\n$600/MWh in late March. Further out, power for 2004-2006 at mid-Columbia \\nRiver, a key trading hub north of California, has fallen from $58/MWh in \\nFebruary to $49/MWh today. \\nCompanies like Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Dynegy (DYN) that took advantage of \\nthe state\\'s buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy. In fact, they have \\naffectionately started calling the governor Gravy Days. Enron Corp. (ENE), \\nwhich has been selling aggressively for two months, according to traders, is \\nlooking like a genius as usual. Generators that held out, like Reliant Energy \\n(REI) and Duke Energy (DUK), may be sorry that they did. \\nIt\\'s been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious \\npain in the markets, but that time has come. Power generators may not make as \\nmuch profit this summer as last, and power traders that have taken long \\nspeculative positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought \\nthem. As was seen in the eastern U.S. power markets last summer, long \\npositions can turn out just as painful as short positions. \\nFor California, the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this summer \\nwon\\'t be as bad as once expected. The bad news is that the state government \\nis by far the biggest \"long\" in the bearish forward market. It\\'s safe to say \\nthat the $43 billion in contracts signed in March have declined in value by \\n15%, or $6.5 billion. That\\'s almost as big of a financial disaster going \\nforward as everything that has gone on since last summer until now. \\nGranted, this is a sort of damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don\\'t situation. \\nBarring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years of \\nderegulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in U.S. \\nhistory. California should do some forward purchasing now, and it\\'s such a \\nbehemoth that it will move the market up when it does so. And, when it gets \\ndone buying, prices will come down simply because it stopped. \\nBut that\\'s a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the \\nenergy crisis. Early this year, when the state started down the path of \\nmega-purchasing, there was no shortage of advice not to do so. Long-term \\nprices were embedded with too much of today\\'s supply-demand imbalance. The \\nstate would have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first - \\nsince it would have to do that anyway - and gradually securing forward power \\nas declining prices reflected the improving situation. \\nSince then, the state has done a great job of crushing demand. Electric usage \\nis already down 9% from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation \\nefforts and a slowing economy, and people haven\\'t even seen their 30% higher \\nbills yet. Similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other \\nwestern states and in natural gas usage nationally. This is likely what has \\nbeen behind much of the downturn in forward power prices in the West. \\nThis column started with a false \"good news\" lead. It would be great for the \\nstate if, after the state\\'s credit rating sinks further, sellers exercised \\ntheir option to tear up the five- and ten-year contracts. But they won\\'t do \\nthat. The prices are too good from the sellers\\' perspective. Calpine, which \\nhas signed three such contracts for the state, said immediately that it has \\nno intention of reneging on its agreements. And Gary Ackerman, director of \\nthe sellers\\' association, told the Mercury News that he didn\\'t expect power \\ncompanies in general to back out of the deals. \\nBut there may be some real good news for California. The Davis administration \\nhired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading to \\npurchase billions of dollars of power. Perhaps they are quick learners. This \\nweek presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it \\nneeds - summer power for this year only - on sale. Low prices in the daily \\nmarket Monday and Tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to $325/MWh, \\nwhich is cheap by recent standards. The contract price moved up to $390/MWh, \\nbut the state took advantage of the opportunity while the window was open. \\n\"The week\\'s condition in the market place helped. We were able to procure \\nsome energy for June through September,\" said state spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. \\nAnd, hey, there were no blackouts this week. \\n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

With \\nmarket observers expecting stocks to be flat or range-bound for a while as \\nthe economy gropes toward a recovery, these investors were selling options to \\ngenerate income upfront and hoping the sold contracts will expire unexercised.\\nMany investors sold out-of-the-money calls as part of strategies like covered \\ncall writing to help lower their cost of buying stock and the break-even \\npoints for their investments. \\nIn Ericsson Telephone Co., for instance, the June 7.50 calls traded more than \\n29,000 contracts, with much of Friday\\'s volume accounted for by investors \\nselling these out-of-the-money contracts. Investors, who earn about $25 for \\neach contract sold, likely were selling these as part of their covered call \\nwriting strategies. \\nEricsson\\'s American depository receipts most recently gained 43 cents to \\n$6.83. At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the June 7.50 calls rose 15 \\ncents to 30 cents on volume of 19,967 contracts, compared with open interest \\nof 7,291. Another 9,415 contracts traded at other exchanges. \\nIn Microsoft Corp., the October 50 puts traded robustly, as they had earlier \\nthis week. It appeared investors were selling these out-of-the-money calls, \\nearning about $150 for each contract and betting that Microsoft stock will \\nremain above $50 by mid-October (or they were willing to buy stock at that \\nprice). \\nWith Microsoft edging down 66 cents to $67.51, the October 50 puts traded \\n20,437 contracts, adding to open interest of 20,297. These puts were up 5 \\ncents to $1.50 at the American Stock Exchange. \\nBecause options volatility already had fallen significantly, some investors \\nthink it is risky to sell options - selling volatility in trader speak - at \\nthis time, since a sudden stock selloff could trigger anxiety and raise \\noption premium and make it more costly to buy back these sold options. \\nBut with no major economic events on the calendar until well into June, and \\nwith a long holiday weekend coming up later this months, investors also are \\nwary about being long volatility. \\nThis is one reason why it makes sense for option sellers to focus on selling \\nlonger-dated options that expire more than six months in future, noted \\nMichael Schwartz, CIBC Oppenheimer\\'s chief options strategist. These \\nlonger-term options pack a greater dollar premium, which translates to a \\nlower break-even point when sold as part of covered call writing strategies \\nand give investors more downside protection. \\nThe CBOE\\'s market volatility index, or VIX, fell 0.52 to 25.00. \\nThe options market\\'s tech-sector fear gauges or Nasdaq volatility indexes \\nalso eased to their lowest levels in nearly eight months - a sign of \\ngathering investor complacency toward tech stocks. \\nThe CBOE\\'s Nasdaq volatility index, or VXN, fell 4.28 to 54.41. VXN has not \\nreached this level since it closed at 54.25 on October 19 last year. \\nThe American Stock Exchange\\'s Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, lost 4.35 to \\n46.20 - its lowest level since it closed at 45.12 on September 29 last year. \\nElsewhere in the options market: \\n- Cree Inc.\\'s stock and options are active Friday with investors appearing to \\nmake bullish bets on the maker of semiconductor materials. \\nIt isn\\'t clear what drove these optimistic trades, but the company has \\nindicated it isn\\'t currently in active talks with potential acquirers. Cree \\nstock was up 12.1% or $3.73 to $34.53 on heavy trading volume, after rising \\n11.4% Thursday. In the options market, at least one investor was buying \\nnear-month, out-of-the-money calls and selling long-term options that expire \\nin 2003 - usually a sign he expects stock to appreciate in the near term. \\n- Enron Corp.\\'s June options were active as a large spread traded. An \\ninstitutional investor bought more than 5,000 contracts of the June 55 calls \\nand sold a roughly equal number of the June 50 puts to help offset the cost. \\nThe investor likely is bullish about Enron and does not expect the stock to \\nfall below $50 by mid-June, or is willing to buy stock at that price. \\nEnron most recently was up $2.02 to $54.24. At the Philadelphia Stock \\nExchange, the June 55 calls were up 60 cents to $2.05 on volume of 7,001 \\ncontracts, compared with open interest of 4,674. The June 50 puts were at \\n$1.05 on volume of 5,000 contracts, compared with open interest of 2,353. \\n-By Kopin Tan, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2202; kopin.tan@dowjones.com \\n(Kaja Whitehouse contributed to this report.)\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

While the projects initially involve gas, the\\nwinners will have a lead should the country open access to its\\ncrude oil reserves, the world\\'s largest.\\n     ``I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be spectacularly lucrative, but\\nthere are other, pressing reasons to be there,\\'\\' said Julian Lee,\\nan analyst at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London,\\nwhich was founded by former Saudi oil minister Sheikh Zaki Yamani.\\n``It\\'s part of a long-term play by the oil companies who want\\nultimately to get access again to Saudi crude.\\'\\'\\n     Saudi Arabia took over its oil fields following the Arab oil\\nembargo that started in 1973. The awards culminate three years of\\ntalks and lobbying by the companies with Saudi Arabia, whose\\nnatural-gas reserves are the world\\'s fifth largest.\\n     The South Ghawar project is the centerpiece of the kingdom\\'s\\nplan and will include Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP\\nand Phillips, SPA said. No decision has been made on a leader for\\nthe project, which is expected by analysts to cost $17 billion.\\n     Shell, Conoco and Total were chosen for the Shaybah project,\\nwhich may cost $4 billion. Exxon Mobil will lead an estimated $4\\nbillion project, including Occidental and Enron in the Red Sea\\ndevelopment, the official Saudi Press Agency said, citing Saudi\\nForeign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.\\n\\n                         Agreements\\n\\n     The partners will soon sign preliminary agreements in the\\nnext few weeks, the government said, though terms have yet to be\\ndecided. Fahnestock & Co. analyst Fadel Gheit expects the\\ncompanies to see a return on investment of 10 percent to\\n15 percent.\\n     Foreign companies had hoped to regain access to Saudi\\nArabia\\'s oil fields, though the government instead sought gas\\ndevelopments.\\n     ``The ultimate objective is to get a better seat at the table\\nin terms of the oil,\\'\\' said Jurjen Lunshof, an analyst at Credit\\nLyonnais Securities Europe. ``But you wonder whether the terms\\nwill make sense.\\'\\'\\n     Even so, Exxon shares rose as much as $1.45, or 1.6 percent,\\nto $90.18, while Phillips advanced $2.13, or 3.2 percent, to $68\\nand Enron gained as much as $2.20 to $54.40. In London, BP rose\\n10.5 pence to 625p and Shell Transport & Trading climbed 15 pence\\nto 615p.\\n     Three companies -- Chevron Corp., Eni SpA and Marathon-USX\\nGroup -- also bid for projects. Those who aren\\'t participating\\neither submitted inappropriate proposals or rejected the\\ngovernment\\'s invitation, SPA said. Also absent is Texaco Inc.,\\nwhich Chevron is buying.\\n\\n                         Economic Woes\\n\\n     Saudi Arabia has been running budget deficits for most of the\\nlast two decades and has a public debt some 10 percent bigger than\\nits $120 billion economy. The country needs foreign investment to\\nhelp create enough jobs for the 100,000 men entering the market\\neach year.\\n     ``The construction of an energy superhighway will provide a\\nspurt of growth that should carry the kingdom for many years,\\'\\'\\nsaid Brad Bourland, the chief economist at Saudi American Bank,\\nbefore the results were announced. ``The spin-off benefit will be\\nthe creation of thousands of new jobs for Saudis.\\'\\'\\n     The kingdom\\'s state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will\\nhold equity and oversee the projects, though it is expected to\\nbear none of the costs.\\n     Exxon has already invested more than $5 billion in the\\ncountry, including a 50 percent stake in the Yanbu Petrochemical\\nCo., when more than $2 billion was raised from more than 30 Saudi\\nArabian, regional and international banks. Shell has already\\ninvested more than $7 billion.\\n\\n                         Power Demand\\n\\n     Saudi Arabia needs about $120 billion for power generation\\nprojects during the next 20 years, with the annual demand growth\\nfor electricity in the kingdom estimated at 4.5 percent, reported\\nKing Fahd University in Dhahran.\\n     To meet this demand the country must increase power\\ngeneration to 70,000 megawatts by 2020 from 21,000 now.\\n     Saudi Arabia produces 4.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day,\\nequal to 800,000 barrels of oil a day, all for domestic use. By\\nusing more gas at home, the country will free up about 300,000\\nbarrels of oil a day for export.\\n     Drilling and production costs for Saudi gas wells will be\\n30 percent to 50 percent more than for Saudi oil wells, a boon for\\nservice companies already active in the kingdom such as Nabors\\nIndustries Inc. and BJ Services Co.\\n     ``This is the most significant development possible for the\\noilfield-services industry, outside of burgeoning new activity off\\nAngola and Brazil,\\'\\' Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst George Gaspar\\nsaid.',\n",

Please call with any question.\\n\\nMei-Ling\\n\\nFrom:\\tKaster, Mei-Ling\\nSent:\\tWednesday, September 19, 2001 7:47 PM\\nTo:\\tAlvares, Joana; Ausucua, Adrian; Berger, Peter; Boe, Larry A.

You all know the drill very well.\\n\\nThe 3rd CE  is due on October 10 and the files are saved in g:\\\\common\\\\jvm\\\\reporting\\\\EGA Regions\\\\2001\\\\Current Estimate\\\\3rd CE folder. \\n\\nThe requirements include \\n\\n   1.   Major Assumptions\\n   2.   Income Statement in both Corp format and EGAS format( same as \"Hannon format\" - 100% project income, Enron\\'s IBIT and Enron\\'s NI).   A folder named \"EGAS Format\" was created within \"3rd CE\" folder for you to save \"EGAS Format income statement\".\\n   3.   Indirect Cash Flow\\n   4.   Variance Explanation for both 3CE vs Plan and 3CE vs 2CE( We only need the explanation of IBIT variance for 3CE vs 2CE)\\n\\nPlease provide the variance explanation for 3CE vs Plan in the \"Variance Explanation\" column (set up to the right of the monthly income statement) for your project.  Please provide the IBIT variance explanation for 3CE vs 2CE in the sheet named \"Var Expl 3CE vs 2CE\" for your project.\\n\\nJust a few friendly reminders,\\n\\n1.\\tPlease tie out August actuals to Hyperion by September 26 and drop in September flash in the 3rd CE file. The tentative due date for September flash is Friday, October 5th. Please do not change September final flash numbers while you work on the 3rd CE. \\n\\n2.\\tPlease do not change the plan numbers.\\n\\n3.\\tThese files are linked to the consolidation file.  Please do not insert/delete columns/rows or change the page setup or print range.\\n\\n4.\\tPlease do not copy value to or put your links into those cells with formula such as \"subtotal\" or \"total\".\\n\\nWe all have very tight deadlines among plan, forecast, earnings release, current estimate and others.  Your cooperation is very imperative to the success of these processes.   Please adhere to the due dates if all possible.  Please feel free to call with any question or suggestion.  Thanks for your effort and assistance.\\n\\n\\nMei-Ling',\n",

The Cal-ISO is calling on all California\\nelectricity customers to increase their energy-conservation efforts, and\\nurging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after 8 p.m. Responsib=\\nle\\nfor the reliability of California\\'s electricity grid, the Cal-ISO declares\\na Stage One emergency when the state\\'s power reserves drop to 7 percent.\\nIn contrast, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the\\nmunicipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area,\\nannounced that its more than 3.7 million businesses and residences are\\nenjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into\\nthe holiday season.\\n\\nANALYSIS: What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman, LADWP\\'s genera=\\nl\\nmanager. Just two years ago the municipal utility=01*the largest city-owned\\nutility in the United States=01*was ridden with massive debts and faced an\\nuncertain future. Now, LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success\\nstory on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself\\nfrom the California crisis. Back in 1997, Freeman was brought on board\\nat LADWP (from the Cal-ISO, no less) to essentially save what was thought\\nto be a sinking ship. Straddled with $7.9 billion in debt, the need to\\ncut about 1,500 jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident=\\nial\\nand industrial customers, Freeman\\'s decision to take on the role of managin=\\ng\\nLADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task. Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP\\nwith an aggressive reorganization in mind, including the primary goal of\\nlowering rates and becoming debt-free by 2003.\\n\\nEarly on, Freeman made a critical decision=01*one that in hindsight appears\\nto be flawless=01*for LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the state\\'s th=\\nree\\nIOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) continued down the treacherous path of=20\\nrestructuring.\\nWhile the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means\\nof averting market power issues (due to agreements established with the\\nCPUC) LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State=\\ns\\nelecting to keep the integrated utility model. In addition, Freeman blocked\\nongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWP\\'s trading\\nunit, and thus maintained control over the muni\\'s generation assets.\\n\\nEnter the summer of California\\'s discontent. With demand on an unexpected\\nincrease and supplies in questionable availability, LADWP found itself\\nhaving the upper hand. The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl=\\ny\\nhas favored generators, and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies\\nthat capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand. Critics accuse=\\nd\\nLADWP of \"profiteering,\" but Freeman contended that the utility was just\\ntaking advantage of California\\'s flawed market. The truth is that LADWP\\nwas in the right place at the right time, and maximized its ability to\\ngenerate cash via power trading, which it used to drive down its debt.\\nA shrewd move by any estimation.\\n\\nThe utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season, illustrated\\nby the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards. Some report=\\ns\\nindicate that LADWP earned about $45 million just from surplus power over\\nthe course of the summer. These profits only added to what LADWP had made\\nin the previous year. Fiscal year 1999 wholesale energy marketing and=20\\ntransmission\\nservices generated $98 million, which, along with other sources of wholesal=\\ne\\nrevenue, marked a growth of 118-percent over 1998.\\n\\nThe problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped\\nwith the onset of cooler temperatures. Ongoing structural problems within\\nthe state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and\\nwarnings of sudden increases in prices. As noted, the state continues to\\nface new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has\\nbeen forced off, including a substantial amount from plants that had expire=\\nd\\nair emissions credits. A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwest=01*a=\\nnother\\ncarry over problem from the summer=01*also has complicated the situation in\\nCalifornia.\\n\\nAnd, while the state IOUs evaluate long-terms contracts with energy provide=\\nrs\\n(based on today\\'s high prices), LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv=\\ne\\ngeneration plan. Among its objectives are to add 2,900 MW of power generati=\\non\\nwithin its service territory in the Los Angeles basin. The end result of\\nthis would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant\\nsupply available at times of peak demand. Also high on the list of Freeman\\'=\\ns\\npriorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative\\nenergy sources. Already demonstrating a good record for green power, LADWP\\nwants to cut its NOx  emissions at its in-basin plants by 65 percent by\\n2010. Toward that end, just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte=\\nd\\nfor two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los\\nAngeles area. The first 250 kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver=\\ned\\nin the fourth quarter of 2001, and the second in the first quarter of 2002.\\nA previously ordered 250 kW fuel cell power plant, announced last year,\\nis to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of 2001.\\n\\n\\nAlong with having no worries about supply, LADWP customers also can look\\nforward to a 5-percent rate reduction that should take effect by 2002,\\nfollowed by a 10-percent rate reduction that has been proposed for 2003.\\nAs criticism continues to mount against California\\'s competitive wholesale\\nmarket, it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting\\nout of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago.\\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\\nSCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

The exchange ratio\\nrepresents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing\\nstock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18%\\npremium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25%\\npremium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during\\nthe 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron\\nshareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco\\nshareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an\\nenterprise value of more than $100 billion.\\n\\nThe new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent\\n(BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and\\noperations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the\\nnation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1\\nmillion BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,\\nwith 4.2 billion BOE of proved reserves.\",\n",

We are in contact with the Arcos Town \\nHall to see if they will be issuing official attendance numbers in advance of \\nthe opposition group, which can be sure to distort numbers.\\n\\nOur PR consultant is in contact today with local media and will be in Arcos \\nat the weekend to gauge the mood - if the demonstration does not attract many \\nsupporters, we will not comment publicly.  However, we will assess the \\nsituation on Sunday, and if there is a very large turnout, we may set up some \\ninterviews for Ignacio Soneira during the afternoon with local press and \\nradio.  These interviews will be used to communicate that: Enron continues to \\nbelieve in the positive benefits of the project for the region; the project \\nhas been subject to extensive public consultation; we have obtained our \\nEnvironmental Impact Declaration and a large number of other permits; \\ndifferent opinions are to be welcomed in a democracy, and in fact the project \\ndoes have support from many parts of the local community.\\n\\nIt is important to note that local politicians are setting great store by the \\nsuccess or otherwise of this weekend's demonstration - one key factor will be \\nthe ratio of Arcos residents present versus outsiders.  We will be continuing \\nwith our ongoing PR activities - adverts, presentations, sponsorships, \\ninterviews etc - next week, so that we are not seen to be backing off from \\nthe project following the demonstration.\\n\\nSome local politicians are predicting that the level of turnout may in the \\nend depend on the weather.  \\n\\n\\nTordesillas\\n\\nThe demonstration which took place a few days ago in Tordesillas did attract \\na large number of local people (in the thousands).  The Tordesillas Mayor has \\nnow said that if local people are against the plant, then she too is against \\nthe project.  Our media response on this issue is that the consultation \\nprocess is ongoing and that the Environmental Impact Report is due out within \\nthe next few weeks.  \\n\\nThe demonstration and the Mayor's position has attracted substantial local \\npress coverage - the obvious concern is that these latest developments get \\npicked up by newswires (one energy publication has picked up on the \\nsituation) and spread through Spain to Arcos.\\n\\nJackie Gentle and I will be visiting Tordesillas and Arcos next week to \\ndiscuss the latest developments.\"},\n",

FIALKA\\nStaff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\\nWASHINGTON -- The Clinton Administration and federal energy regulators stepped\\nup efforts to respond to a politically disastrous rise in California \\nelectricity\\nprices, threatening to go as far as re-regulating some prices if they \\ndetermine\\nthat the free-market experiment in the state has failed.\\nThe moves by federal authorities come as California regulators and lawmakers\\nscramble to come up with an expedient solution to high power prices in the San\\nDiego area, where monthly bills have in some cases quadrupled since last \\nsummer.\\n\\'Workably Competitive\\'\\nIn a 21-page order issued Wednesday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\\nsaid that under the Federal Power Act it can intervene to limit the prices\\ncharged by generators to the California market -- if it determines the prices\\nthey are charging aren\\'t \"just and reasonable,\" and the market is not \\n\"workably\\ncompetitive.\"\\nThe order accompanied an upgrade of the FERC\\'s effort from a staff probe to a\\nformal investigation, requested by President Clinton, who also Wednesday\\nextended $2.6 million in federal emergency loans to low-income residents in \\nthe\\nSan Diego area to help pay their electric bills.\\n\"There is a crisis of confidence in California wholesale electricity markets\\nthat threatens to erode the political consensus necessary to sustain a\\nmarket-based approach to regulation,\" William Massey, one of four FERC\\ncommissioners, said Wednesday in an opinion attached to the order. \"In these\\ncircumstances, the FERC must act forcefully and decisively to ... insist that\\njurisdictional wholesale markets produce consumer benefits and just and\\nreasonable rates.\"\\nAs prices have risen, power generators such as Duke Energy\\n</pj/q-quote.cgi?sym=duk&type=company> Co., the local utility, San Diego Gas &\\nElectric Co. and public officials have all pointed the finger at one another \\nfor\\nwhat appears to be a badly flawed market. California governor Gray Davis, who \\nis\\npushing for local legislation that would lower bills and accelerate \\npower-plant\\nconstruction, Wednesday said \"out-of-state generators\" were most responsible \\nfor\\n\"bringing San Diego residents to their knees.\"\\nFERC\\'s action Wednesday originated in a complaint filed Aug. 2 by San Diego \\nGas\\n& Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy </pj/q-quote.cgi?sym=sre&type=company>, \\nthe\\nutility whose customers have raised the most outrage over the rate rises.\\nThe utility sold off its plants and now buys all the power its customers use \\nout\\nof a state-sanctioned auction, passing those market costs directly through to\\nits customers.\\nA Warning to Generators\\nSteve Baum, Sempra Energy chairman, said FERC\\'s action is a warning to\\ngenerators \"that the prices they\\'ve been receiving are now at risk.\" He \\nexpects\\nFERC to eventually issue a ruling that California\\'s market isn\\'t competitive,\\nsetting the stage for a possible return to cost-based rates in periods of high\\ndemand. Prior to deregulation in 1998, the rates utilities charged for\\nelectricity were based on their underlying cost. Deregulation allowed them to\\ncharge whatever the market would bear.\\nCalifornia\\'s Governor Orders Regulators to Slash Electric Rates in Southern\\nAreas (Aug. 10)\\nMr. Clinton said the FERC investigation would allow Washington to \"better\\nunderstand\" what is happening in the California market so the government can\\nprotect consumers there and in other deregulated states.\\nWhile politicians and regulators seek solutions, wholesale power prices in\\nCalifornia are becoming more aberrant.\\nEven on days when consumption and prices normally drop, such as Sundays, \\nprices\\nhave been stubbornly high this summer. For example, the auction price of\\nelectricity to be consumed at 10 p.m. last Sunday was $125.48 per megawatt, or\\nmore than four times the price such power commanded on the third Sunday of\\nAugust in 1999. The markup is especially noteworthy because actual demand on\\nthat day was 12% lower than on the comparable day a year earlier.\\n\"A number of people are looking at the high prices trying to figure out what\\'s\\ngoing on,\" says Jesus Arredondo, spokesman for the state-sanctioned entity \\nthat\\nruns the state\\'s day-ahead energy auction, the California Power Exchange in\\nPasadena, Calif.\\nThese prices have remained high despite the best efforts of public officials.\\nFor instance, the organization that runs the state\\'s electric grid and is\\nresponsible for keeping consumers constantly supplied with electricity has\\nreduced the maximum price it will pay for electricity this summer to $250 per\\nmegawatt hour from $750. While this action has capped peak prices, it has also\\ncaused an increase in the overall number of hours in which prices are \\nabnormally\\nhigh.\\nTake Wednesday for instance. Prices for power in California never dropped \\nbelow\\n$108 per megawatt hour, even for power contracted for delivery in the dead of\\nnight, and the hourly price was at or above $200 in 13 of 24 hours despite \\nonly\\nmoderately high demand.\\nCalifornia\\'s problems are likely to step up pressure on Congress to pass \\nomnibus\\nlegislation which would provide uniform national rules for deregulated state\\nenergy markets and make more efficient the interstate power-transmission \\nsystem,\\nMr. Clinton said Wednesday.\\nThe administration has pushed for such a measure but the House Commerce\\nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over the legislation, still appears \\ndeadlocked\\non the details. It plans to hold a hearing in California on electricity-market\\nconditions there next month.\\n-- Marc Lifsher contributed to this article.\\nWrite to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com <mailto:rebecca.smith@wsj.com>\\nand John J.

His status for Thur=\\nsday\\'s game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd=\\nated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven=\\n passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in th=\\ne game, but he\\'s expected to be fine for this weekend\\'s contest at Carolina=\\n.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a =\\nstrained right hamstring during Sunday\\'s game against Philadelphia. He did =\\nnot return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , W=\\nR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit=\\n on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured=\\n his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy =\\nCarter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his h=\\namstring has healed enough that he\\'s ready to return to action. However, th=\\ne Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his =\\nstarting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seas=\\non to determine if he\\'ll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jac=\\nkson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-De=\\naler it was a coach\\'s decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson h=\\nad been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had i=\\nndicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benj=\\namin Gay, Jackson\\'s Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB D=\\nAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this week=\\nend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he\\'ll remain the team\\'s =\\nstarting quarterback for the time being. However, he\\'s no better than waive=\\nr wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Up=\\ndated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday\\'s game against Denver in the first quart=\\ner due to a rib injury. His status for next week\\'s game against Philadelphi=\\na is uncertain at this time. Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19=\\n/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday\\'s game against Denver, t=\\nold the Washington Post that there\\'s a \"definite possibility\" he would be r=\\neady in time for next weekend\\'s game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham woul=\\nd start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy=\\n option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/=\\n19/01 Smith left Sunday\\'s game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. H=\\nowever, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas ! fa! ces D=\\nenver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/=\\n19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday\\'s game against A=\\nrizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent U=\\npdated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday\\'s win over =\\nArizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert=\\n Emanuel  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee in=\\njury during Sunday\\'s game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Mu=\\nhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left=\\n shoulder in Sunday\\'s game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 ga=\\nme against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated=\\n 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redsk=\\nins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 t! im! es for 28 yards. It is apparen=\\nt Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gar=\\ny will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WA=\\nS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards =\\nand a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, a=\\nnd Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Pl=\\nummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four T=\\nDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare =\\nfor Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman ,=\\n RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman =\\nto 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don\\'t start Pittman in any upcoming week=\\ns unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent =\\nUpdated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at A=\\nrizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, ! wh! o always=\\n gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agen=\\nt Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caugh=\\nt 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Wa=\\nrren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good=\\n Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Up=\\ndated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but h=\\ne rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don\\'t count on Dunn for consi=\\nstently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive=\\n, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18=\\n/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed =\\nto get in the end zone again. Don\\'t depend on Johnson down the stretch unle=\\nss your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent =\\nUpdated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one! p! ass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The =\\nrookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M=\\narty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven pass=\\nes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker ha=\\ns become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week=\\n, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent =\\nUpdated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The=\\n second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy pla=\\nyer.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put u=\\np decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown.=\\n His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may =\\nhave something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseaso=\\nn.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes fo=\\nr 112 yards and a TD against Jackson! vi! lle. While he doesn\\'t score often=\\n, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he wi=\\nll always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 1=\\n1/18/01 Flutie\\'s recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for o=\\nnly 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is =\\nbecoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/1=\\n8/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He =\\nhas not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owner! s ! this sea=\\nson.   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid ou=\\nting against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He\\'s on=\\ne of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start ev=\\nery week.

This lack of a \"demand response\" is \\na key problem affecting all U.S. power markets, Larcamp said.\\n\\n\"Demand has been growing at very high rates,\" he said, citing 5% annual \\ngrowth in some regions and 7% growth last year in California.\\n\\nOne solution may be to allow retail customers, particularly industrial \\nconsumers, to re-sell their power into the market at prevailing rates, \\nLarcamp suggested.\\n\\nHowever, he noted such a program would have to be structured to avoid legal \\nproblems under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act.\\n\\n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-6647, \\nmailto:bryan.lee@dowjones.com\\n\\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 13-10-00',\n",

Gov. says near deal to buy SDG&E power grid\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\\nContent-Disposition: inline\\n\\nFYI\\n\\nMonday May 7, 4:37 pm Eastern Time\\n\\nCalif. Gov. says near deal to buy SDG&E power grid\\n\\nLOS ANGELES, May 7 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis, seeking to piece \\ntogether a takeover of the state\\'s power transmission grid, said Monday he \\nhoped to have an agreement by the end of the week to buy the high voltage \\npower lines owned by Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) utility subsidiary San \\nDiego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).\\n\\n``I think that will be resolved, hopefully before the week is out ... I \\nbelieve we are very, very close to resolving that issue,\\'\\' Davis told a news \\nconference here.\\n\\nDavis has made state ownership of the transmission grid a key part of his \\nplan to solve the state\\'s energy crisis and revive its three cash-strapped \\ninvestor owned utilities.\\n\\nSDG&E owns about 1,800 miles (2,897 km) of transmission lines. The deal is \\nbelieved to be priced at roughly $1 billion plus the assumption of around 200 \\nmillion of debt, which equates to around 2.3 times book value\\n\\nDavis has reached a tentative agreement to buy Edison International (NYSE:EIX \\n- news) unit Southern California Edison\\'s transmission grid for $2.76 \\nbillion, also roughly 2.3 times its book value.\\n\\nSimilar talks to buy the grid belonging to San Francisco- based Pacific Gas \\nand Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news) collapsed in early \\nApril when the utility put itself into voluntary bankruptcy protection.',\n",

Apologies for the fact that they are quick and \\ndirty.\\n\\nAll Enron\\'s public statements that I have read, including, I think, \\nstatements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California \\nis not \"material.\"  Dennis\\' declaration says that the situation in California \\nhas been a \"financial disaster,\" that \"Enron has lost over $300 million,\" and \\nthat \"Enron stands to lose millions more.\"  The losses are described as \\n\"huge.\"  Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the \\nmarket, but I\\'m not aware of it.  And if it hasn\\'t, it could represent a \\nsignificant conflict with previous statements.  Seems prudent to run this by \\nIR and perhaps others before releasing.\\nRegarding the statements about our hedging strategy.  It would seem prudent \\nto run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to \\nmaking public.\\nVery minor technical point--I don\\'t think that AB 1890 was passed \\n\"unanimously.\"  I think that there was 1 nay vote.\\nThe statement is made that \"the utilities were required to sell off most of \\ntheir generating capacity.\"  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 \\nof their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to \\nabout .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of \\nthe remainder of their fossil-fired plants.\\nIt is stated that stranded costs are \"investments in imprudent power \\ngeneration facilities.\"  These investments were in fact found in the past to \\nbe prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them \\nimprudent now.\\nIs it now \"virtually impossible to manage commodity risk\" in California?  \\nJust wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation \\nsomewhat.\\nFrom a PR perspective, I\\'m wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing \\nUC/CSU in the following manner, \"It was actually a relatively easy decision \\nto make.\"  Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed.\\n\\n\\nBest,\\nJeff'},\n",

       "  'Body': \"The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.\\n\\nIn order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. \\n\\nCrude and Products group\\nMid-marketing\\nBill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  \\n\\nOrigination\\nIn order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. \\n\\nTrading\\nLee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  \\n\\nShipping\\nScott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.\\n\\nWeather\\nThe weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  \\n\\nCoal\\nMark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.\\n\\nEnron Japan\\nThe momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.\\n\\nLNG\\nLNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.\\n\\nNeal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.\\n\\nEnron Freight Markets\\nEFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  \\n\\nGlobal Risk Markets\\nDavid Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.\\n\\nBrad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.\\n\\nIn April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.\\n\\nFinancial Trading\\nElsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  \\n\\nPlease congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.\",\n",

In addition to the letter to \\nthe CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to \\nterminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale \\nagreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I \\nprepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing \\nnecessary to file with FERC.

Under Steve Hopper's \\nleadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday.  During the \\ncrisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael \\nMegarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached).  \\nAt the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the \\nsite, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and \\ndiscussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing \\ninaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image.   \\n\\nI also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident \\nCommander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in \\nresponse to stakeholder concerns.  The Plan was updated daily by the \\nTransredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every \\nmeeting/conference call.   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement \\nthe Operations Report.  \\n\\nI also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early \\nstages of the crisis.  It was extremely helpful.\\n\\nRegards, Keith\",\n",

This will not require any technical \\nchanges, enhancements, etc., and should be very easy for us to handle....  I \\nreceived the responses below from Dave, and sent him my response.

They want to start trading asap - we gathered all the initial \\ninformation we would need to get the product type set up.  Here are the facts:\\n\\nFinancial products only (but he wants to offer physical products in the near \\nfuture.  The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move \\nthe product do not exist  - the same challenge the paper guys have).\\nWe are not trading this product OTC yet\\nThe GTC's and long descriptions are in draft format.  Harry Collins (Legal) \\nis working on - Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close \\non this\\nThe key customer list consists of approx. 50 customers (450 additional) - we \\nrequested this by Friday so that Credit can get started.  I will send a note \\nto Debbie Brackett tonight.  As you can imagine, most of these are customers \\nwe are not currently doing business with, and the steel industry has not been \\nthe most profitable the last few years, so I am not sure how many of these \\nwill even get approved.\\nBack office systems - they have not decided what they are going to use yet -  \\nSitara, TAGG or some other system (really irrelevant for you, but we will \\nbridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant \\nthis)\\nThey have not determined which index/publication they will use (most likely \\nsomething called Metal Bulletin)\\nThe first two product types will be Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled\\nAll products will be offered in USD\\nWe need to determine if the products will be offered by EIM or ENA - I am \\nfairly sure it will be ENA, but we are discussing with legal.  Greg was not \\nsure...\\n\\n\\nThis may not be news to you, but just in case, I wanted to make sure you were \\nin the loop.

The band\\ndoubles back to the street right below\\nus and\\nserenades us with Texas Fight and The\\nEyes of Texas.\\nAWESOME MOMENT.\\n12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,\\n50-100 grown\\nmen are bumping chests with one\\nanother, each and\\nevery one of them now secure and\\ncertain of the fact\\nthat we are going to kick the\\nshit out of Nebraska.\\n1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the\\nway to the\\nAlamodome. Again, we hoot and holler\\nlike wildmen.\\nAgain, the band doubles back and stops\\nright below us\\nto serenade us, this time, however,\\nwith the Nebraska\\nfight songs. Although somewhat\\nimpressed by their\\nspirit and verve, we remain convinced\\nthat we are\\ngoing to kick the shit out of\\nNebraska.\\n1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,\\nsomehow\\nmanaging to stuff the \"Traveler\" and 11\\ncans of beer\\ninto my pants.\\n1:47 I am in line surrounded by\\nNebraska fans. They\\nare taunting me. I am taunting back,\\nstill certain\\nthat we are going to kick the\\nshit out of Nebraska. I\\ndecide to challenge a particularly\\nvocal Nebraska fan\\nto play what I now call and will\\nforever be remembered\\nas \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\" Remember flop\\nout for a\\ndollar? The rules are similar. I tell\\nthis Nebraska\\njackass that if he\\'s so confident in\\nhis team, he\\nshould \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT\\nNOW and make\\nplane reservations to Phoenix for the\\nFiesta Bowl.\\nAnd then I spoke these memorable words:\\n\"And not\\nthose\\ndamn refundable tickets, either! You\\nrequest those\\nnon-refundable, non-transferrable\\nsons-of-bitches!\"\\nHe backs down. He is unworthy. I call\\nSouthwest\\nAirlines and buy two tickets to\\nPhoenix,\\nnon-refundable\\nand non-transferrable. Price: $712. He\\nis humbled.\\nHe lowers his head in shame. I raise my\\ncell phone in\\ntriumph to the cheers of hundreds of\\nTexas fans. I am\\nKING and these are my subjects. I\\ndistribute the 11\\nbeers in my pants to the cheering\\nmasses. I RULE the\\npre-game kingdom.\\n2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,\\nI open the\\nTraveler and pour my first stiffy.\\n2:45 I notice something troubling:\\nNebraska is big.\\nNebraska is fast. Nebraska is very\\npissed off at\\nTexas.\\n3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.\\n9 yards\\ntotal offense for Texas. Zero first\\ndowns for Texas.\\nI\\'m still talking shit. I pour\\nanother stiffy from\\nthe Traveler.\\n3:36 Four minutes to go in the first\\nhalf: the\\nTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy my\\nfirst $5 beer\\nfrom the Alamodome merchants. While I\\nam standing in\\nline, a center snap nearly decapitates\\nMajor\\nApplewhite\\nand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.\\n3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas\\n0. I wish I\\nhad another Traveler.\\n4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska\\nfan in the\\nbathroom at halftime, I attempt to\\nrevive the classic\\nBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\\n\"Hey, buddy,\\nniiiiiiiiice cock.\" He is\\nunamused.\\n4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from\\nthe Alamodome\\nmerchants. I share my beer with two\\nhigh school girls\\nsitting behind me. Surprisingly, they\\nare equipped\\nwith a flask full of vodka. I send them\\noff to\\npurchase $5 Sprites, so that we may\\nconsume their\\nvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska\\nis a bunch of\\npussies.\\n4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting\\nbehind me have\\nfled for their lives. I purchase two\\nmore $5 beers\\nfrom the Alamodome merchants.\\n5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I\\nam beginning\\nto lose faith. This normally would\\ntrouble me, but I\\nam too drunk to see the football field.\\n\\n5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I\\'m\\nsorry, sir.\\nThose tickets have been confirmed and\\nare\\nnon-refundable and non-transferrable.\"\\n5:37 I try to start a fight with every\\nperson behind\\nthe concession counter. As it turns\\nout, the\\nAlamodome has a policy that no beer can\\nbe sold when\\nthere is less than 10 minutes on the\\ngame clock. I am\\nenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:\\n\"Why the fuck\\ndidn\\'t you announce last call over the\\nfucking PA\\nsystem??!!\"\\n5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in\\nmy chair in\\ndefeat. All of a sudden, the Texas\\ncrowd goes\\nabsolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter,\\nawaking from\\nmy coma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\"\\nAlas, the\\nanswer is no, we were not winning and\\nwe did not\\nscore.\\nThe largest (by far) cheer of the day\\nfrom the Texas\\nfaithful occurred when the handlers\\nwere walking back\\nto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take\\na gargantuan\\nshit all over the letters \"S\",\\n\"K\", and \"A\" in the\\n\"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end\\nzone. I cheer\\nwildly. I pick up the empty Traveler\\nbottle and stick\\nmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.\\n6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as\\nI walk back\\nto the truck. I would taunt them with\\nsome off-color\\nremarks about their parentage, but I am\\ntoo drunk to\\nform complete sentences. With my last\\ncognitive\\nthought of the evening, I take solace\\nin the fact that\\nif we had not beaten them in October,\\nthey would be\\nplaying Florida State for the national\\nchampionship.\\n6:30 Back in the car. On the way back\\nto Austin for\\nthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can\\nstill salvage\\nthe day! I crack open a beer. It is\\nwarm. I don\\'t\\ncare.\\n7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am\\nhungry. I go\\ninside the store. I walk past the beer\\nfrig. I\\nnotice a Zima. I\\'ve never had a Zima. I\\nwonder if\\nit\\'s any good. I pull a Zima from the\\nfrig. I twist\\nthe top off and drink the Zima in three\\nswallows.\\nZima\\nsucks. I replace the empty bottle in\\nthe frig.\\n7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the\\nstore. I walk to\\nwhere the ingredients are, where the\\nperson usually\\nmakes the sub. There is no one there. I\\nlean over\\nthe counter and scoop out half a bucket\\nof black\\nolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.\\nI lean\\nfurther over the counter and grab\\napproximately two\\npounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the\\nstore\\ngrunting and eating Pastrami. The\\npatrons in the\\nstore fear me. I don\\'t care.\\n8:01 We are in South Austin. I have\\nbeen drinking\\nwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn\\ntunes for over\\nan hour. My truck-mate is tired of my\\nsinging. He\\nsuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn\\nhave written\\nother good songs besides \"You\\'re Going\\nto Miss Me When\\nI\\'m Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" and that\\nmaybe listening to\\nonly those two songs, ten times each\\nwas a bit\\nexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I\\ncould just let the\\nCD play on its own. I tell him to\\nfuck off and\\nrestart \"Neon Moon.\"\\n8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My\\ntruckmate,\\nagainst my loud and profane\\nprotestations, parks on\\nthe top floor of a nearby parking\\ngarage. I tell him\\nhe\\'s an idiot. I tell him we will never\\nget out. I\\ntell him we may as well pitch a\\nfucking tent here. He\\nignores me. I think he\\'s still pissed\\nabout the\\nBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon\\nMoon\" loudly.\\n8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers\\nstuffed in\\nmy pants. We\\'re going to kick the\\nshit out of\\nArizona.\\n9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona\\n29. I am\\npleased. I go to the bathroom to pee\\nfor the 67th\\ntime today. I giggle to myself because\\nof the\\nnew opportunity to do \"the bathroom\\nBrice.\" There are\\nno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am\\ndisappointed.\\nI tell myself (out loud) that I have a\\n\"Niiiiiice\\ncock.\" No one is amused but me.\\n9:41 I walk to the bathroom while\\ndrinking Bud Light\\nout of a can. Needless to say, they do\\nnot sell beer\\nat the Erwin Center, much less Bud\\nLight out of a can.\\nI am stopped by an usher: \"Where did\\nyou get\\nthat, sir?\" I tell him (no shit):\\n\"Oh, the\\ncheerleaders were throwing them up with\\nthose little\\nplastic footballs. Would you mind\\nthrowing this away\\nfor me?\" I take the last swig and hand\\nit to him. He\\nis confused. I pretend I\\'m going to the\\nbathroom, but\\nI run away giggling instead. I duck\\ninto some\\nentrance to avoid the usher, who is now\\npursuing me.\\nI sneak into a large group of people\\nand sit down.\\nThe\\nusher walks by harmlessly. I am\\ngiggling like a little\\ngirl. I crack open another can of Bud\\nLight.\\n9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid\\nthe usher, I\\nhave lost my bearings. I have no ticket\\nstub. I\\ncannot find my seats. Texas is losing.\\n10:09 Texas is being screwed by the\\nrefs. I am\\nenraged. I have cleared out the seats\\naround me\\nbecause I keep removing my hat and\\nbeating the\\nsurrounding chairs with it. A concerned\\nfan asks if\\nI\\'m OK and perhaps I shouldn\\'t take it\\nso seriously.\\nI tell him to fuck off.\\n10:15 After the fourth consecutive\\n\"worst fucking\\ncall I have EVER seen,\" I attempt to\\nremove my hat\\nagain to begin beating inanimate\\nobjects. However, on\\nthis occasion I miscalculate and I\\nthumbnail myself in\\nmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter\\ninch gash over\\nmy eye. I am now bleeding into my left\\neye and all\\nover my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to\\nmyself, \"I\\'m\\ntaking this a bit seriously.\"\\n10:22 I am standing in the bathroom\\npeeing. I\\'m so\\ndrunk I am swaying and grunting. I have\\na bloody\\nnapkin pressed on my left eye. My pants\\nare bloody.\\nI have my (formerly) white shirt\\nwrapped around my\\nwaist. I look like I should be in an\\nepisode of Cops.\\n10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody\\nwhite shirt\\nback on my body and make my way for the\\nexits. I am\\nstopped every 20 seconds by a good\\nsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me\\nwhy I am\\ncovered in blood, but I merely grunt\\nincoherently and\\nkeep moving.\\n10:59 With my one good eye, I have\\nlocated the\\nparking garage. I walk up six flights\\nof stairs,\\npromise that when I see my friend I\\nwill punch him\\nin the face for making me walk up six\\nflights of\\nstairs, find the truck, and collapse in\\na heap in the\\nbed of the truck. I look around and\\nnotice that\\ntraffic is lined up all the way around\\nthe garage, six\\nwhole flights, and no one is moving. I\\ntake a nap.\\n11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my\\nfriend in the\\ndriver\\'s seat. I lift my head to look\\nout the bed of\\nthe truck and notice that traffic is\\nlined up all the\\nway around the garage, six whole\\nflights, and no one\\nis\\nmoving. I am too tired to punch my\\nfriend. I call my\\nfriend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\\n11:31 I lift my head to look out the\\nbed of the truck\\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\\nthe way around\\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\\none is moving.\\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\\n\\n11:38 I lift my head to look out the\\nbed of the truck\\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\\nthe way around\\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\\none is moving.\\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\\n\\n11:47 I lift my head to look out the\\nbed of the truck\\nand notice that traffic is lined up all\\nthe way around\\nthe garage, six whole flights, and no\\none is moving.\\nI call my friend a \"Stupid fuck.\"\\n\\n11:58 I am jostled. The truck is\\nmoving. I lift my\\nhead to look out the bed of the truck\\nand notice that\\ntraffic is beginning to move on the\\nsecond floor. I\\njump out of the truck, walk to the edge\\nof the parking\\nfacility, and pee off the sixth floor\\nonto the street\\nbelow. My friend looks at me like I\\njust anally\\nviolated his minor sister. I turn\\naround and pee\\non the front of his truck while singing\\nthe lyrics\\nto \"Neon Moon.\"\\n12:11 We are moving. We are out of\\nbeer. I jump\\nfrom the truck and go from vehicle to\\nvehicle until\\nsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.\\nI return to\\nmy vehicle.\\n12:26 We have emerged from the parking\\nfacility. We\\nmake our way to my apartment and find\\nEd sitting on\\nthe couch with a freshly opened bottle\\nof Glenlivet on\\nthe coffee table in front of him. We\\nare all going to\\ndie tonight.\\n12:59 We have finished three-quarters\\nof the bottle\\nof Glenlivet. We decide it would be a\\nwonderful idea\\nto go dancing at PollyEsther\\'s. Ed has\\nto pee. He\\nwalks down the hall to our apartment\\nand directly into\\nthe full length mirror at the end of\\nthe hall,\\nsmashing it into hundreds of pieces. We\\ngiggle\\nuncontrollably and leave for\\nPollyEsther\\'s.\\n1:17 The PollyEsther\\'s doorman laughs\\nuncontrollably\\nat our efforts to enter his club.\\n\"Fellas,\" he says\\nin between his fits of spastic\\nlaughter, \"I\\'ve been\\nworking this door for almost a year.\\nI\\'ve been\\nworking\\ndoors in this town for almost 5 years.\\nAnd I can\\nhonestly say that I ain\\'t never seen\\nthree drunker\\nmother fuckers than you three.\\nSorry, can\\'t let you\\nin.\" We attempt to reason with him. He\\nlaughs\\nharder.\\n1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We\\ntake two\\nsteps in the door and hear \"Last call\\nfor alcohol!\" I\\nturn to the group and mutter: \"See, dat\\nwasn\\'t that\\nfuckin\\' hard. Day don\\'t fuckin\\' do that\\nat the\\nAwamo...the awaom...the\\nalab...fuck it, that stadium\\nwe\\nwas at today...\" We order 6 shots of\\ntequila and\\nthree beers.\\n2:15 Back on the street. We need food.\\nWe hail a\\ncab to take us the two and one half\\nblocks to Katz\\'s.\\nThe cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10\\nand tell him\\nto keep it.\\n2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give\\nthe hostess\\n$50. We are seated immediately.\\n2:25 We order two orders of fried\\npickles, a Cobb\\nsalad, a bowl of soup, two orders of\\nBlueberry\\nblintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a\\nhamburger, two\\ncheese stuffed potatoes, an order of\\nfries, and an\\norder of onion rings.\\n2:39 The food arrives. We are all\\nasleep with our\\nheads on the table. The waiter wakes us\\nup. We eat\\nevery fucking bit of our food. Most\\nof the restaurant\\npatrons around us are disgusted. We\\ndon\\'t give a\\nshit.\\nThe tab is $112 with tip.\\n2:46 I\\'m sleepy.\\n9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.\\nShe is the\\nbartender at Katz\\'s. She is not pretty.',\n",

I reckon these models can be \\nchecked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets) \\nand all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I \\nbecame interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether \\nthis model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the \\nforecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just \\ncopied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is \\nnot very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable \\nconfidence.  As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more \\nthan 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the \\nnext 3-4 months out with the long-term model.\\n\\nHope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nAnjam\\nx35383\\n\\nPLLU:    DZCV:\",\n",
